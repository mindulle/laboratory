Modules - Introduction
======================

This document is divided into four sections:

1.  The first section develops the [**theory**](theory) behind how
    TypeScript approaches modules. If you want to be able to write the
    correct module-related compiler options for any situation, reason
    about how to integrate TypeScript with other tools, or understand
    how TypeScript processes dependency packages, this is the place to
    start. While there are guides and reference pages on these topics,
    building an understanding of these fundamentals will make reading
    the guides easier, and give you a mental framework for dealing with
    real-world problems not specifically covered here.
2.  The [**guides**](guides/choosing-compiler-options) show how to
    accomplish specific real-world tasks, starting with picking the
    right compilation settings for a new project. The guides are a good
    place to start both for beginners who want to get up and running as
    quickly as possible and for experts who already have a good grasp of
    the theory but want concrete guidance on a complicated task.
3.  The [**reference**](reference) section provides a more detailed look
    at the syntaxes and configurations presented in previous sections.
4.  The [**appendices**](appendices/esm-cjs-interop) cover complicated
    topics that deserve additional explanation in more detail than the
    theory or reference sections allow.
