Package buildinfo
=================

-   `import "debug/buildinfo"`
-   [Overview](#pkg-overview)
-   [Index](#pkg-index)

Overview 
--------

Package buildinfo provides access to information embedded in a Go binary
about how it was built. This includes the Go toolchain version, and the
set of modules used (for binaries built in module mode).

Build information is available for the currently running binary in
runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo.

### Package files

buildinfo.go

type BuildInfo 
-----------------------------------------------

Type alias for build info. We cannot move the types here, since
runtime/debug would need to import this package, which would make it a
much larger dependency.

```go
type BuildInfo = debug.BuildInfo
```

### func Read 

```go
func Read(r io.ReaderAt) (*BuildInfo, error)
```

Read returns build information embedded in a Go binary file accessed
through the given ReaderAt. Most information is only available for
binaries built with module support.

### func ReadFile 

```go
func ReadFile(name string) (info *BuildInfo, err error)
```

ReadFile returns build information embedded in a Go binary file at the
given path. Most information is only available for binaries built with
module support.
