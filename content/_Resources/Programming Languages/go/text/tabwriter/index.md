Overview 
--------

Package tabwriter implements a write filter (tabwriter.Writer) that
translates tabbed columns in input into properly aligned text.

The package is using the Elastic Tabstops algorithm described at
https://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/index.html>.

The text/tabwriter package is frozen and is not accepting new features.

#### [Example (Elastic)]

Code:

```go
// Observe how the b's and the d's, despite appearing in the
// second cell of each line, belong to different columns.
w := tabwriter.NewWriter(os.Stdout, 0, 0, 1, '.', tabwriter.AlignRight|tabwriter.Debug)
fmt.Fprintln(w, "a\tb\tc")
fmt.Fprintln(w, "aa\tbb\tcc")
fmt.Fprintln(w, "aaa\t") // trailing tab
fmt.Fprintln(w, "aaaa\tdddd\teeee")
w.Flush()
```

Output:

```go
....a|..b|c
...aa|.bb|cc
..aaa|
.aaaa|.dddd|eeee
```

#### [Example (TrailingTab)]

Code:

```go
// Observe that the third line has no trailing tab,
// so its final cell is not part of an aligned column.
const padding = 3
w := tabwriter.NewWriter(os.Stdout, 0, 0, padding, '-', tabwriter.AlignRight|tabwriter.Debug)
fmt.Fprintln(w, "a\tb\taligned\t")
fmt.Fprintln(w, "aa\tbb\taligned\t")
fmt.Fprintln(w, "aaa\tbbb\tunaligned") // no trailing tab
fmt.Fprintln(w, "aaaa\tbbbb\taligned\t")
w.Flush()
```

Output:

```go
------a|------b|---aligned|
-----aa|-----bb|---aligned|
----aaa|----bbb|unaligned
---aaaa|---bbbb|---aligned|
```

Constants 
---------

Formatting can be controlled with these flags.

```go
const (
    // Ignore html tags and treat entities (starting with '&'
    // and ending in ';') as single characters (width = 1).
    FilterHTML uint = 1 << iota

    // Strip Escape characters bracketing escaped text segments
    // instead of passing them through unchanged with the text.
    StripEscape

    // Force right-alignment of cell content.
    // Default is left-alignment.
    AlignRight

    // Handle empty columns as if they were not present in
    // the input in the first place.
    DiscardEmptyColumns

    // Always use tabs for indentation columns (i.e., padding of
    // leading empty cells on the left) independent of padchar.
    TabIndent

    // Print a vertical bar ('|') between columns (after formatting).
    // Discarded columns appear as zero-width columns ("||").
    Debug
)
```

To escape a text segment, bracket it with Escape characters. For
instance, the tab in this string \"Ignore this tab: \\xff\\t\\xff\" does
not terminate a cell and constitutes a single character of width one for
formatting purposes.

The value 0xff was chosen because it cannot appear in a valid UTF-8
sequence.

```go
const Escape = '\xff'
```

type Writer 
-----------

A Writer is a filter that inserts padding around tab-delimited columns
in its input to align them in the output.

The Writer treats incoming bytes as UTF-8-encoded text consisting of
cells terminated by horizontal (\'\\t\') or vertical (\'\\v\') tabs, and
newline (\'\\n\') or formfeed (\'\\f\') characters; both newline and
formfeed act as line breaks.

Tab-terminated cells in contiguous lines constitute a column. The Writer
inserts padding as needed to make all cells in a column have the same
width, effectively aligning the columns. It assumes that all characters
have the same width, except for tabs for which a tabwidth must be
specified. Column cells must be tab-terminated, not tab-separated:
non-tab terminated trailing text at the end of a line forms a cell but
that cell is not part of an aligned column. For instance, in this
example (where \| stands for a horizontal tab):

```go
aaaa|bbb|d
aa  |b  |dd
a   |
aa  |cccc|eee
```

the b and c are in distinct columns (the b column is not contiguous all
the way). The d and e are not in a column at all (there\'s no
terminating tab, nor would the column be contiguous).

The Writer assumes that all Unicode code points have the same width;
this may not be true in some fonts or if the string contains combining
characters.

If DiscardEmptyColumns is set, empty columns that are terminated
entirely by vertical (or \"soft\") tabs are discarded. Columns
terminated by horizontal (or \"hard\") tabs are not affected by this
flag.

If a Writer is configured to filter HTML, HTML tags and entities are
passed through. The widths of tags and entities are assumed to be zero
(tags) and one (entities) for formatting purposes.

A segment of text may be escaped by bracketing it with Escape
characters. The tabwriter passes escaped text segments through
unchanged. In particular, it does not interpret any tabs or line breaks
within the segment. If the StripEscape flag is set, the Escape
characters are stripped from the output; otherwise they are passed
through as well. For the purpose of formatting, the width of the escaped
text is always computed excluding the Escape characters.

The formfeed character acts like a newline but it also terminates all
columns in the current line (effectively calling Flush). Tab- terminated
cells in the next line start new columns. Unless found inside an HTML
tag or inside an escaped text segment, formfeed characters appear as
newlines in the output.

The Writer must buffer input internally, because proper spacing of one
line may depend on the cells in future lines. Clients must call Flush
when done calling Write.

```go
type Writer struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func NewWriter 

```go
func NewWriter(output io.Writer, minwidth, tabwidth, padding int, padchar byte, flags uint) *Writer
```

NewWriter allocates and initializes a new tabwriter.Writer. The
parameters are the same as for the Init function.

### func (\*Writer) Flush 

```go
func (b *Writer) Flush() error
```

Flush should be called after the last call to Write to ensure that any
data buffered in the Writer is written to output. Any incomplete escape
sequence at the end is considered complete for formatting purposes.

### func (\*Writer) Init 

```go
func (b *Writer) Init(output io.Writer, minwidth, tabwidth, padding int, padchar byte, flags uint) *Writer
```

A Writer must be initialized with a call to Init. The first parameter
(output) specifies the filter output. The remaining parameters control
the formatting:

```go
minwidth    minimal cell width including any padding
tabwidth    width of tab characters (equivalent number of spaces)
padding     padding added to a cell before computing its width
padchar     ASCII char used for padding
        if padchar == '\t', the Writer will assume that the
        width of a '\t' in the formatted output is tabwidth,
        and cells are left-aligned independent of align_left
        (for correct-looking results, tabwidth must correspond
        to the tab width in the viewer displaying the result)
flags       formatting control
```

#### [Example]

Code:

```go
w := new(tabwriter.Writer)

// Format in tab-separated columns with a tab stop of 8.
w.Init(os.Stdout, 0, 8, 0, '\t', 0)
fmt.Fprintln(w, "a\tb\tc\td\t.")
fmt.Fprintln(w, "123\t12345\t1234567\t123456789\t.")
fmt.Fprintln(w)
w.Flush()

// Format right-aligned in space-separated columns of minimal width 5
// and at least one blank of padding (so wider column entries do not
// touch each other).
w.Init(os.Stdout, 5, 0, 1, ' ', tabwriter.AlignRight)
fmt.Fprintln(w, "a\tb\tc\td\t.")
fmt.Fprintln(w, "123\t12345\t1234567\t123456789\t.")
fmt.Fprintln(w)
w.Flush()
```

Output:

```go
a  b   c   d       .
123 12345   1234567 123456789   .

    a     b       c         d.
  123 12345 1234567 123456789.
```

### func (\*Writer) Write 

```go
func (b *Writer) Write(buf []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write writes buf to the writer b. The only errors returned are ones
encountered while writing to the underlying output stream.
