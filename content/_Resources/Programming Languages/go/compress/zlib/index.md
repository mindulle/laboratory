Package zlib

Overview 
--------

Package zlib implements reading and writing of zlib format compressed
data, as specified in RFC 1950.

The implementation provides filters that uncompress during reading and
compress during writing. For example, to write compressed data to a
buffer:

```go
var b bytes.Buffer
w := zlib.NewWriter(&b)
w.Write([]byte("hello, world\n"))
w.Close()
```

and to read that data back:

```go
r, err := zlib.NewReader(&b)
io.Copy(os.Stdout, r)
r.Close()
```

Constants 
---------

These constants are copied from the flate package, so that code that
imports \"compress/zlib\" does not also have to import
\"compress/flate\".

```go
const (
    NoCompression      = flate.NoCompression
    BestSpeed          = flate.BestSpeed
    BestCompression    = flate.BestCompression
    DefaultCompression = flate.DefaultCompression
    HuffmanOnly        = flate.HuffmanOnly
)
```

Variables 
---------

```go
var (
    // ErrChecksum is returned when reading ZLIB data that has an invalid checksum.
    ErrChecksum = errors.New("zlib: invalid checksum")
    // ErrDictionary is returned when reading ZLIB data that has an invalid dictionary.
    ErrDictionary = errors.New("zlib: invalid dictionary")
    // ErrHeader is returned when reading ZLIB data that has an invalid header.
    ErrHeader = errors.New("zlib: invalid header")
)
```

func NewReader 
--------------

```go
func NewReader(r io.Reader) (io.ReadCloser, error)
```

NewReader creates a new ReadCloser. Reads from the returned ReadCloser
read and decompress data from r. If r does not implement io.ByteReader,
the decompressor may read more data than necessary from r. It is the
caller\'s responsibility to call Close on the ReadCloser when done.

The ReadCloser returned by NewReader also implements Resetter.

#### [Example]

Code:

```go
buff := []byte{120, 156, 202, 72, 205, 201, 201, 215, 81, 40, 207,
    47, 202, 73, 225, 2, 4, 0, 0, 255, 255, 33, 231, 4, 147}
b := bytes.NewReader(buff)

r, err := zlib.NewReader(b)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
io.Copy(os.Stdout, r)
```

Output:

```go
hello, world
```

func NewReaderDict 
------------------

```go
func NewReaderDict(r io.Reader, dict []byte) (io.ReadCloser, error)
```

NewReaderDict is like NewReader but uses a preset dictionary.
NewReaderDict ignores the dictionary if the compressed data does not
refer to it. If the compressed data refers to a different dictionary,
NewReaderDict returns ErrDictionary.

The ReadCloser returned by NewReaderDict also implements Resetter.

type Resetter 
--------------------------------------------

Resetter resets a ReadCloser returned by NewReader or NewReaderDict to
switch to a new underlying Reader. This permits reusing a ReadCloser
instead of allocating a new one.

```go
type Resetter interface {
    // Reset discards any buffered data and resets the Resetter as if it was
    // newly initialized with the given reader.
    Reset(r io.Reader, dict []byte) error
}
```

type Writer 
-----------

A Writer takes data written to it and writes the compressed form of that
data to an underlying writer (see NewWriter).

```go
type Writer struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func NewWriter 

```go
func NewWriter(w io.Writer) *Writer
```

NewWriter creates a new Writer. Writes to the returned Writer are
compressed and written to w.

It is the caller\'s responsibility to call Close on the Writer when
done. Writes may be buffered and not flushed until Close.

#### [Example]

Code:

```go
var b bytes.Buffer

w := zlib.NewWriter(&b)
w.Write([]byte("hello, world\n"))
w.Close()
fmt.Println(b.Bytes())
```

Output:

```go
[120 156 202 72 205 201 201 215 81 40 207 47 202 73 225 2 4 0 0 255 255 33 231 4 147]
```

### func NewWriterLevel 

```go
func NewWriterLevel(w io.Writer, level int) (*Writer, error)
```

NewWriterLevel is like NewWriter but specifies the compression level
instead of assuming DefaultCompression.

The compression level can be DefaultCompression, NoCompression,
HuffmanOnly or any integer value between BestSpeed and BestCompression
inclusive. The error returned will be nil if the level is valid.

### func NewWriterLevelDict 

```go
func NewWriterLevelDict(w io.Writer, level int, dict []byte) (*Writer, error)
```

NewWriterLevelDict is like NewWriterLevel but specifies a dictionary to
compress with.

The dictionary may be nil. If not, its contents should not be modified
until the Writer is closed.

### func (\*Writer) Close 

```go
func (z *Writer) Close() error
```

Close closes the Writer, flushing any unwritten data to the underlying
io.Writer, but does not close the underlying io.Writer.

### func (\*Writer) Flush 

```go
func (z *Writer) Flush() error
```

Flush flushes the Writer to its underlying io.Writer.

### func (\*Writer) Reset 

```go
func (z *Writer) Reset(w io.Writer)
```

Reset clears the state of the Writer z such that it is equivalent to its
initial state from NewWriterLevel or NewWriterLevelDict, but instead
writing to w.

### func (\*Writer) Write 

```go
func (z *Writer) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write writes a compressed form of p to the underlying io.Writer. The
compressed bytes are not necessarily flushed until the Writer is closed
or explicitly flushed.
