Package trace
=============

Overview 
--------

Package trace contains facilities for programs to generate traces for
the Go execution tracer.

### Tracing runtime activities 

The execution trace captures a wide range of execution events such as
goroutine creation/blocking/unblocking, syscall enter/exit/block,
GC-related events, changes of heap size, processor start/stop, etc. When
CPU profiling is active, the execution tracer makes an effort to include
those samples as well. A precise nanosecond-precision timestamp and a
stack trace is captured for most events. The generated trace can be
interpreted using \`go tool trace\`.

Support for tracing tests and benchmarks built with the standard testing
package is built into \`go test\`. For example, the following command
runs the test in the current directory and writes the trace file
(trace.out).

```go
go test -trace=trace.out
```

This runtime/trace package provides APIs to add equivalent tracing
support to a standalone program. See the Example that demonstrates how
to use this API to enable tracing.

There is also a standard HTTP interface to trace data. Adding the
following line will install a handler under the /debug/pprof/trace URL
to download a live trace:

```go
import _ "net/http/pprof"
```

See the net/http/pprof package for more details about all of the debug
endpoints installed by this import.

### User annotation 

Package trace provides user annotation APIs that can be used to log
interesting events during execution.

There are three types of user annotations: log messages, regions, and
tasks.

[Log](#Log) emits a timestamped message to the execution trace along
with additional information such as the category of the message and
which goroutine called [Log](#Log). The execution tracer provides UIs to
filter and group goroutines using the log category and the message
supplied in [Log](#Log).

A region is for logging a time interval during a goroutine\'s execution.
By definition, a region starts and ends in the same goroutine. Regions
can be nested to represent subintervals. For example, the following code
records four regions in the execution trace to trace the durations of
sequential steps in a cappuccino making operation.

```go
trace.WithRegion(ctx, "makeCappuccino", func() {

   // orderID allows to identify a specific order
   // among many cappuccino order region records.
   trace.Log(ctx, "orderID", orderID)

   trace.WithRegion(ctx, "steamMilk", steamMilk)
   trace.WithRegion(ctx, "extractCoffee", extractCoffee)
   trace.WithRegion(ctx, "mixMilkCoffee", mixMilkCoffee)
})
```

A task is a higher-level component that aids tracing of logical
operations such as an RPC request, an HTTP request, or an interesting
local operation which may require multiple goroutines working together.
Since tasks can involve multiple goroutines, they are tracked via a
context.Context object. [NewTask](#NewTask) creates a new task and
embeds it in the returned context.Context object. Log messages and
regions are attached to the task, if any, in the Context passed to
[Log](#Log) and [WithRegion](#WithRegion).

For example, assume that we decided to froth milk, extract coffee, and
mix milk and coffee in separate goroutines. With a task, the trace tool
can identify the goroutines involved in a specific cappuccino order.

```go
ctx, task := trace.NewTask(ctx, "makeCappuccino")
trace.Log(ctx, "orderID", orderID)

milk := make(chan bool)
espresso := make(chan bool)

go func() {
        trace.WithRegion(ctx, "steamMilk", steamMilk)
        milk <- true
}()
go func() {
        trace.WithRegion(ctx, "extractCoffee", extractCoffee)
        espresso <- true
}()
go func() {
        defer task.End() // When assemble is done, the order is complete.
        <-espresso
        <-milk
        trace.WithRegion(ctx, "mixMilkCoffee", mixMilkCoffee)
}()
```

The trace tool computes the latency of a task by measuring the time
between the task creation and the task end and provides latency
distributions for each task type found in the trace.

#### [Example]

Example demonstrates the use of the trace package to trace the execution
of a Go program. The trace output will be written to the file trace.out

Code:

```go
package trace_test

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"
    "runtime/trace"
)

// Example demonstrates the use of the trace package to trace
// the execution of a Go program. The trace output will be
// written to the file trace.out
func Example() {
    f, err := os.Create("trace.out")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to create trace output file: %v", err)
    }
    defer func() {
        if err := f.Close(); err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("failed to close trace file: %v", err)
        }
    }()

    if err := trace.Start(f); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to start trace: %v", err)
    }
    defer trace.Stop()

    // your program here
    RunMyProgram()
}

func RunMyProgram() {
    fmt.Printf("this function will be traced")
}
```

### Examples

[Package](#example_)


### Package files

annotation.go trace.go

func IsEnabled 
-----------------------------------------------

```go
func IsEnabled() bool
```

IsEnabled reports whether tracing is enabled. The information is
advisory only. The tracing status may have changed by the time this
function returns.

func Log 
-----------------------------------------

```go
func Log(ctx context.Context, category, message string)
```

Log emits a one-off event with the given category and message. Category
can be empty and the API assumes there are only a handful of unique
categories in the system.

func Logf 
------------------------------------------

```go
func Logf(ctx context.Context, category, format string, args ...any)
```

Logf is like [Log](#Log), but the value is formatted using the specified
format spec.

func Start 
-----------------------------------------

```go
func Start(w io.Writer) error
```

Start enables tracing for the current program. While tracing, the trace
will be buffered and written to w. Start returns an error if tracing is
already enabled.

func Stop 
----------------------------------------

```go
func Stop()
```

Stop stops the current tracing, if any. Stop only returns after all the
writes for the trace have completed.

func WithRegion 
------------------------------------------------

```go
func WithRegion(ctx context.Context, regionType string, fn func())
```

WithRegion starts a region associated with its calling goroutine, runs
fn, and then ends the region. If the context carries a task, the region
is associated with the task. Otherwise, the region is attached to the
background task.

The regionType is used to classify regions, so there should be only a
handful of unique region types.

type Region 
--------------------------------------------

Region is a region of code whose execution time interval is traced.

```go
type Region struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func StartRegion 

```go
func StartRegion(ctx context.Context, regionType string) *Region
```

StartRegion starts a region and returns it. The returned Region\'s
[Region.End](#Region.End) method must be called from the same goroutine
where the region was started. Within each goroutine, regions must nest.
That is, regions started after this region must be ended before this
region can be ended. Recommended usage is

```go
defer trace.StartRegion(ctx, "myTracedRegion").End()
```

### func (\*Region) End 

```go
func (r *Region) End()
```

End marks the end of the traced code region.

type Task 
------------------------------------------

Task is a data type for tracing a user-defined, logical operation.

```go
type Task struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func NewTask 

```go
func NewTask(pctx context.Context, taskType string) (ctx context.Context, task *Task)
```

NewTask creates a task instance with the type taskType and returns it
along with a Context that carries the task. If the input context
contains a task, the new task is its subtask.

The taskType is used to classify task instances. Analysis tools like the
Go execution tracer may assume there are only a bounded number of unique
task types in the system.

The returned Task\'s [Task.End](#Task.End) method is used to mark the
task\'s end. The trace tool measures task latency as the time between
task creation and when the End method is called, and provides the
latency distribution per task type. If the End method is called multiple
times, only the first call is used in the latency measurement.

```go
ctx, task := trace.NewTask(ctx, "awesomeTask")
trace.WithRegion(ctx, "preparation", prepWork)
// preparation of the task
go func() {  // continue processing the task in a separate goroutine.
    defer task.End()
    trace.WithRegion(ctx, "remainingWork", remainingWork)
}()
```

### func (\*Task) End 

```go
func (t *Task) End()
```

End marks the end of the operation represented by the [Task](#Task).
