Overview 
--------

Package maphash provides hash functions on byte sequences. These hash
functions are intended to be used to implement hash tables or other data
structures that need to map arbitrary strings or byte sequences to a
uniform distribution on unsigned 64-bit integers. Each different
instance of a hash table or data structure should use its own Seed.

The hash functions are not cryptographically secure. (See crypto/sha256
and crypto/sha512 for cryptographic use.)

#### [Example]

Code:

```go
// The zero Hash value is valid and ready to use; setting an
// initial seed is not necessary.
var h maphash.Hash

// Add a string to the hash, and print the current hash value.
h.WriteString("hello, ")
fmt.Printf("%#x\n", h.Sum64())

// Append additional data (in the form of a byte array).
h.Write([]byte{'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd'})
fmt.Printf("%#x\n", h.Sum64())

// Reset discards all data previously added to the Hash, without
// changing its seed.
h.Reset()

// Use SetSeed to create a new Hash h2 which will behave
// identically to h.
var h2 maphash.Hash
h2.SetSeed(h.Seed())

h.WriteString("same")
h2.WriteString("same")
fmt.Printf("%#x == %#x\n", h.Sum64(), h2.Sum64())
```

func Bytes 
-------------------------------------------

```go
func Bytes(seed Seed, b []byte) uint64
```

Bytes returns the hash of b with the given seed.

Bytes is equivalent to, but more convenient and efficient than:

```go
var h Hash
h.SetSeed(seed)
h.Write(b)
return h.Sum64()
```

func String 
--------------------------------------------

```go
func String(seed Seed, s string) uint64
```

String returns the hash of s with the given seed.

String is equivalent to, but more convenient and efficient than:

```go
var h Hash
h.SetSeed(seed)
h.WriteString(s)
return h.Sum64()
```

type Hash 
------------------------------------------

A Hash computes a seeded hash of a byte sequence.

The zero Hash is a valid Hash ready to use. A zero Hash chooses a random
seed for itself during the first call to a Reset, Write, Seed, or Sum64
method. For control over the seed, use SetSeed.

The computed hash values depend only on the initial seed and the
sequence of bytes provided to the Hash object, not on the way in which
the bytes are provided. For example, the three sequences

```go
h.Write([]byte{'f','o','o'})
h.WriteByte('f'); h.WriteByte('o'); h.WriteByte('o')
h.WriteString("foo")
```

all have the same effect.

Hashes are intended to be collision-resistant, even for situations where
an adversary controls the byte sequences being hashed.

A Hash is not safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines, but a Seed
is. If multiple goroutines must compute the same seeded hash, each can
declare its own Hash and call SetSeed with a common Seed.

```go
type Hash struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func (\*Hash) BlockSize 

```go
func (h *Hash) BlockSize() int
```

BlockSize returns h\'s block size.

### func (\*Hash) Reset 

```go
func (h *Hash) Reset()
```

Reset discards all bytes added to h. (The seed remains the same.)

### func (\*Hash) Seed 

```go
func (h *Hash) Seed() Seed
```

Seed returns h\'s seed value.

### func (\*Hash) SetSeed 

```go
func (h *Hash) SetSeed(seed Seed)
```

SetSeed sets h to use seed, which must have been returned by MakeSeed or
by another Hash\'s Seed method. Two Hash objects with the same seed
behave identically. Two Hash objects with different seeds will very
likely behave differently. Any bytes added to h before this call will be
discarded.

### func (\*Hash) Size 

```go
func (h *Hash) Size() int
```

Size returns h\'s hash value size, 8 bytes.

### func (\*Hash) Sum 

```go
func (h *Hash) Sum(b []byte) []byte
```

Sum appends the hash\'s current 64-bit value to b. It exists for
implementing hash.Hash. For direct calls, it is more efficient to use
Sum64.

### func (\*Hash) Sum64 

```go
func (h *Hash) Sum64() uint64
```

Sum64 returns h\'s current 64-bit value, which depends on h\'s seed and
the sequence of bytes added to h since the last call to Reset or
SetSeed.

All bits of the Sum64 result are close to uniformly and independently
distributed, so it can be safely reduced by using bit masking, shifting,
or modular arithmetic.

### func (\*Hash) Write 

```go
func (h *Hash) Write(b []byte) (int, error)
```

Write adds b to the sequence of bytes hashed by h. It always writes all
of b and never fails; the count and error result are for implementing
io.Writer.

### func (\*Hash) WriteByte 

```go
func (h *Hash) WriteByte(b byte) error
```

WriteByte adds b to the sequence of bytes hashed by h. It never fails;
the error result is for implementing io.ByteWriter.

### func (\*Hash) WriteString 

```go
func (h *Hash) WriteString(s string) (int, error)
```

WriteString adds the bytes of s to the sequence of bytes hashed by h. It
always writes all of s and never fails; the count and error result are
for implementing io.StringWriter.

type Seed 
------------------------------------------

A Seed is a random value that selects the specific hash function
computed by a Hash. If two Hashes use the same Seeds, they will compute
the same hash values for any given input. If two Hashes use different
Seeds, they are very likely to compute distinct hash values for any
given input.

A Seed must be initialized by calling MakeSeed. The zero seed is
uninitialized and not valid for use with Hash\'s SetSeed method.

Each Seed value is local to a single process and cannot be serialized or
otherwise recreated in a different process.

```go
type Seed struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func MakeSeed 

```go
func MakeSeed() Seed
```

MakeSeed returns a new random seed.
