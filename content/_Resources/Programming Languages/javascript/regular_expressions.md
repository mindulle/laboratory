Regular expressions
===================

 
A **regular expression** (*regex* for short) allow developers to match
strings against a pattern, extract submatch information, or simply test
if the string conforms to that pattern. Regular expressions are used in
many programming languages, and JavaScript\'s syntax is inspired by
[Perl](https://www.perl.org/).

You are encouraged to read the [regular expressions
guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions)
to get an overview of the available regex syntaxes and how they work.


 
Description
-----------

 
[*Regular
expressions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are a
important concept in formal language theory. They are a way to describe
a possibly infinite set of character strings (called a *language*). A
regular expression, at its core, needs the following features:

-   A set of *characters* that can be used in the language, called the
    *alphabet*.
-   *Concatenation*: `ab` means \"the character `a` followed by the
    character `b`\".
-   *Union*: `a|b` means \"either `a` or `b`\".
-   *Kleene star*: `a*` means \"zero or more `a` characters\".

Assuming a finite alphabet (such as the 26 letters of the English
alphabet, or the entire Unicode character set), all regular languages
can be generated by the features above. Of course, many patterns are
very tedious to express this way (such as \"10 digits\" or \"a character
that\'s not a space\"), so JavaScript regular expressions include many
shorthands, introduced below.

 
**Note:** JavaScript regular expressions are in fact not regular, due to
the existence of [backreferences](regular_expressions/backreference)
(regular expressions must have finite states). However, they are still a
very useful feature.




 
### Creating regular expressions 

 
A regular expression is typically created as a literal by enclosing a
pattern in forward slashes (`/`):

 
 
[js]


```js
const regex1 = /ab+c/g;
```


Regular expressions can also be created with the
[`RegExp()`](global_objects/regexp/regexp) constructor:

 
 
[js]


```js
const regex2 = new RegExp("ab+c", "g");
```


They have no runtime differences, although they may have implications on
performance, static analyzability, and authoring ergonomic issues with
escaping characters. For more information, see the
[`RegExp`](global_objects/regexp#literal_notation_and_constructor)
reference.



 
### Regex flags 

 
Flags are special parameters that can change the way a regular
expression is interpreted or the way it interacts with the input text.
Each flag corresponds to one accessor property on the `RegExp` object.

  ------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  `d`    Generate indices for substring matches.                                                           [`hasIndices`](global_objects/regexp/hasindices)
  `g`    Global search.                                                                                    [`global`](global_objects/regexp/global)
  `i`    Case-insensitive search.                                                                          [`ignoreCase`](global_objects/regexp/ignorecase)
  `m`    Allows `^` and `$` to match next to newline characters.                                           [`multiline`](global_objects/regexp/multiline)
  `s`    Allows `.` to match newline characters.                                                           [`dotAll`](global_objects/regexp/dotall)
  `u`    \"Unicode\"; treat a pattern as a sequence of Unicode code points.                                [`unicode`](global_objects/regexp/unicode)
  `v`    An upgrade to the `u` mode with more Unicode features.                                            [`unicodeSets`](global_objects/regexp/unicodesets)
  `y`    Perform a \"sticky\" search that matches starting at the current position in the target string.   [`sticky`](global_objects/regexp/sticky)


The sections below list all available regex syntaxes, grouped by their
syntactic nature.



 
### Assertions

 
Assertions are constructs that test whether the string meets a certain
condition at the specified position, but not consume characters.
Assertions cannot be [quantified](regular_expressions/quantifier).

[Input boundary assertion: `^`, `$`](regular_expressions/input_boundary_assertion)

:   Asserts that the current position is the start or end of input, or
    start or end of a line if the `m` flag is set.

[Lookahead assertion: `(?=...)`, `(?!...)`](regular_expressions/lookahead_assertion)

:   Asserts that the current position is followed or not followed by a
    certain pattern.

[Lookbehind assertion: `(?<=...)`, `(?<!...)`](regular_expressions/lookbehind_assertion)

:   Asserts that the current position is preceded or not preceded by a
    certain pattern.

[Word boundary assertion: `\b`, `\B`](regular_expressions/word_boundary_assertion)

:   Asserts that the current position is a word boundary.



 
### Atoms

 
Atoms are the most basic units of a regular expression. Each atom
*consumes* one or more characters in the string, and either fails the
match or allows the pattern to continue matching with the next atom.

[Backreference: `\1`, `\2`](regular_expressions/backreference)

:   Matches a previously matched subpattern captured with a capturing
    group.

[Capturing group: `(...)`](regular_expressions/capturing_group)

:   Matches a subpattern and remembers information about the match.

[Character class: `[...]`, `[^...]`](regular_expressions/character_class)

:   Matches any character in or not in a set of characters. When the
    [`v`](global_objects/regexp/unicodesets) flag is enabled, it can
    also be used to match finite-length strings.

[Character class escape: `\d`, `\D`, `\w`, `\W`, `\s`, `\S`](regular_expressions/character_class_escape)

:   Matches any character in or not in a predefined set of characters.

[Character escape: `\n`, `\u`](regular_expressions/character_escape)

:   Matches a character that may not be able to be conveniently
    represented in its literal form.

[Literal character: `a`, `b`](regular_expressions/literal_character)

:   Matches a specific character.

[Named backreference: `\k<name>`](regular_expressions/named_backreference)

:   Matches a previously matched subpattern captured with a named
    capturing group.

[Named capturing group: `(?<name>...)`](regular_expressions/named_capturing_group)

:   Matches a subpattern and remembers information about the match. The
    group can later be identified by a custom name instead of by its
    index in the pattern.

[Non-capturing group: `(?:...)`](regular_expressions/non-capturing_group)

:   Matches a subpattern without remembering information about the
    match.

[Unicode character class escape: `\p`](regular_expressions/unicode_character_class_escape)

:   Matches a set of characters specified by a Unicode property. When
    the [`v`](global_objects/regexp/unicodesets) flag is enabled, it can
    also be used to match finite-length strings.

[Wildcard: `.`](regular_expressions/wildcard)

:   Matches any character except line terminators, unless the `s` flag
    is set.



 
### Other features 

 
These features do not specify any pattern themselves, but are used to
compose patterns.

[Disjunction: `|`](regular_expressions/disjunction)

:   Matches any of a set of alternatives separated by the `|` character.

[Quantifier: `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n}`, `{n,}`, `{n,m}`](regular_expressions/quantifier)

:   Matches an atom a certain number of times.



 
### Escape sequences 

 
*Escape sequences* in regexes refer to any kind of syntax formed by `\`
followed by one or more characters. They may serve very different
purposes depending on what follow `\`. Below is a list of all valid
\"escape sequences\":

  `\d`              None                                                                [Character class escape](regular_expressions/character_class_escape) representing digit characters (`0` to `9`)
  `\f`              None                                                                [Character escape](regular_expressions/character_escape) representing U+000C (FORM FEED)
  `\k`              `<`, an identifier, then `>`                                        A [named backreference](regular_expressions/named_backreference)
  `\n`              None                                                                [Character escape](regular_expressions/character_escape) representing U+000A (LINE FEED)

  `\q`              `{`, a string, then a `}`                                           Only valid inside [`v`-mode character classes](regular_expressions/character_class#v-mode_character_class); represents the string to be matched literally
  `\r`              None                                                                [Character escape](regular_expressions/character_escape) representing U+000D (CARRIAGE RETURN)
  `\s`              None                                                                [Character class escape](regular_expressions/character_class_escape) representing whitespace characters
  `\t`              None                                                                [Character escape](regular_expressions/character_escape) representing U+0009 (CHARACTER TABULATION)

  `\x`              2 hexadecimal digits                                                [Character escape](regular_expressions/character_escape) representing the character with the given value
  `\0`              None                                                                [Character escape](regular_expressions/character_escape) representing U+0000 (NULL)


`\` followed by any other digit character becomes a [legacy octal escape
sequence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Deprecated_and_obsolete_features#escape_sequences),
which is forbidden in [Unicode-aware
mode](global_objects/regexp/unicode#unicode-aware_mode).

In addition, `\` can be followed by some non-letter-or-digit characters,
in which case the escape sequence is always a [character
escape](regular_expressions/character_escape) representing the escaped
character itself:

-   `\$`, `\(`, `\)`, `\*`, `\+`, `\.`, `\/`, `\?`, `\[`, `\\`, `\]`,
    `\^`, `{`, `\|`, `}`: valid everywhere
-   `\-`: only valid inside [character
    classes](regular_expressions/character_class)
-   `\!`, `\#`, `\%`, `\&`, `\,`, `\:`, `\;`, `\<`, `\=`, `\>`, `\@`,
    `` \` ``, `\~`: only valid inside [`v`-mode character
    classes](regular_expressions/character_class#v-mode_character_class)

The other
[ASCII](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ASCII)
characters, namely space character, `"`, `'`, `_`, and any letter
character not mentioned above, are not valid escape sequences. In
[Unicode-unaware
mode](global_objects/regexp/unicode#unicode-aware_mode), escape
sequences that are not one of the above become *identity escapes*: they
represent the character that follows the backslash. For example, `\a`
represents the character `a`. This behavior limits the ability to
introduce new escape sequences without causing backward compatibility
issues, and is therefore forbidden in Unicode-aware mode.
