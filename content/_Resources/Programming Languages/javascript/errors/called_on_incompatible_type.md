TypeError: X.prototype.y called on incompatible type
====================================================


The JavaScript exception \"called on incompatible target (or object)\"
occurs when a function (on a given object), is called with a `this` not
corresponding to the type expected by the function.

[`TypeError`](../global_objects/typeerror)




What went wrong? 
----------------


When this error is thrown, a function (on a given object), is called
with a `this` not corresponding to the type expected by the function.

This issue can arise when using the
[`Function.prototype.call()`](../global_objects/function/call) or
[`Function.prototype.apply()`](../global_objects/function/apply)
methods, and providing a `this` argument which does not have the
expected type.

This issue can also happen when providing a function that is stored as a
property of an object as an argument to another function. In this case,
the object that stores the function won\'t be the `this` target of that
function when it is called by the other function. To work-around this
issue, you will either need to provide a lambda which is making the
call, or use the
[`Function.prototype.bind()`](../global_objects/function/bind) function
to force the `this` argument to the expected object.




Examples
--------



### Invalid cases 




[js]


```js
const mySet = new Set();
["bar", "baz"].forEach(mySet.add);
// mySet.add is a function, but "mySet" is not captured as this.

const myFun = function () {
  console.log(this);
};
["bar", "baz"].forEach(myFun.bind);
// myFun.bind is a function, but "myFun" is not captured as this.
```





### Valid cases 




[js]


```js
const mySet = new Set();
["bar", "baz"].forEach(mySet.add.bind(mySet));
// This works due to binding "mySet" as this.

const myFun = function () {
  console.log(this);
};
["bar", "baz"].forEach((x) => myFun.bind(x));
// This works using the "bind" function. It creates a lambda forwarding the argument.
```
