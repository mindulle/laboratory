SyntaxError: missing ) after condition
======================================

 
The JavaScript exception \"missing ) after condition\" occurs when there
is an error with how an [`if`](../statements/if...else) condition is
written. It must appear in parenthesis after the `if` keyword.

What went wrong? 
----------------

 
There is an error with how an [`if`](../statements/if...else) condition
is written. In any programming language, code needs to make decisions
and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. The if
statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. In
JavaScript, this condition must appear in parenthesis after the `if`
keyword, like this:

 
 
[js]


```js
if (condition) {
  // do something if the condition is true
}
```




 
Examples
--------


 
### Missing parenthesis 

 
It might just be an oversight, carefully check all you parenthesis in
your code.

 
 
[js]


```js
if (Math.PI < 3 {
  console.log("wait what?");
}

// SyntaxError: missing ) after condition
```


To fix this code, you would need to add a parenthesis that closes the
condition.

 
 
[js]


```js
if (Math.PI < 3) {
  console.log("wait what?");
}
```




 
### Misused is keyword 

 
If you are coming from another programming language, it is also easy to
add keywords that don\'t mean the same or have no meaning at all in
JavaScript.

 
 
[js]


```js
if (done is true) {
 console.log("we are done!");
}

// SyntaxError: missing ) after condition
```


Instead you need to use a correct [comparison
operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators).
For example:

 
 
[js]


```js
if (done === true) {
  console.log("we are done!");
}
```


Or even better:

 
 
[js]


```js
if (done) {
  console.log("we are done!");
}
```
