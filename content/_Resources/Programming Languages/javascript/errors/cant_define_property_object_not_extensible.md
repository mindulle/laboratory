TypeError: can\'t define property \"x\": \"obj\" is not extensible
==================================================================


The JavaScript exception \"can\'t define property \"x\": \"obj\" is not
extensible\" occurs when
[`Object.preventExtensions()`](../global_objects/object/preventextensions)
marked an object as no longer extensible, so that it will never have
properties beyond the ones it had at the time it was marked as
non-extensible.



Message
-------


```text
TypeError: Cannot add property x, object is not extensible (V8-based)
TypeError: Cannot define property x, object is not extensible (V8-based)
TypeError: can't define property "x": Object is not extensible (Firefox)
TypeError: Attempting to define property on object that is not extensible. (Safari)
```




Error type 
----------


[`TypeError`](../global_objects/typeerror)




What went wrong? 
----------------


Usually, an object is extensible and new properties can be added to it.
However, in this case
[`Object.preventExtensions()`](../global_objects/object/preventextensions)
marked an object as no longer extensible, so that it will never have
properties beyond the ones it had at the time it was marked as
non-extensible.




Examples
--------



### Adding new properties to a non-extensible objects 


In [strict mode](../strict_mode), attempting to add new properties to a
non-extensible object throws a `TypeError`. In sloppy mode, the addition
of the \"x\" property is silently ignored.



[js]


```js
"use strict";

const obj = {};
Object.preventExtensions(obj);

obj.x = "foo";
// TypeError: can't define property "x": Object is not extensible
```


In both, [strict mode](../strict_mode) and sloppy mode, a call to
[`Object.defineProperty()`](../global_objects/object/defineproperty)
throws when adding a new property to a non-extensible object.



[js]


```js
const obj = {};
Object.preventExtensions(obj);

Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", { value: "foo" });
// TypeError: can't define property "x": Object is not extensible
```


To fix this error, you will either need to remove the call to
[`Object.preventExtensions()`](../global_objects/object/preventextensions)
entirely, or move it to a position so that the property is added earlier
and only later the object is marked as non-extensible. Of course you can
also remove the property that was attempted to be added, if you don\'t
need it.



[js]


```js
"use strict";

const obj = {};
obj.x = "foo"; // add property first and only then prevent extensions

Object.preventExtensions(obj);
```
