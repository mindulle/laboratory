SyntaxError: label not found
============================

 
The JavaScript exception \"label not found\" occurs when a
[`break`](../statements/break) or [`continue`](../statements/continue)
statement references a label that does not exist on any statement that
contains the `break` or `continue` statement.


 
Message
-------

 
```text
SyntaxError: Undefined label 'label' (V8-based)
SyntaxError: label not found (Firefox)
SyntaxError: Cannot use the undeclared label 'label'. (Safari)
```



 
Error type 
----------

 
[`SyntaxError`](../global_objects/syntaxerror).



 
What went wrong? 
----------------

 
In JavaScript, [labels](../statements/label) are very limited: you can
only use them with [`break`](../statements/break) and
[`continue`](../statements/continue) statements, and you can only jump
to them from a statement contained within the labeled statement. You
cannot jump to this label from anywhere in the program.



 
Examples
--------


 
### Unsyntactic jump 

 
You cannot use labels as if they are `goto`.

 
 
[js]


```js
start: console.log("Hello, world!");
console.log("Do it again");
break start;
```


Instead, you can only use labels to enhance the normal semantics of
`break` and `continue` statements.

 
 
[js]


```js
start: {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    break start;
  }
  console.log("Maybe I'm logged");
}
```
