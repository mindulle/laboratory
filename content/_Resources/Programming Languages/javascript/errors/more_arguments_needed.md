What went wrong? 
----------------

 
There is an error with how a function is called. More arguments need to
be provided.



 
Examples
--------


 
### Required arguments not provided 

 
The [`Object.create()`](../global_objects/object/create) method requires
at least one argument and the
[`Object.setPrototypeOf()`](../global_objects/object/setprototypeof)
method requires at least two arguments:

 
 
[js]


```js
const obj = Object.create();
// TypeError: Object.create requires at least 1 argument, but only 0 were passed

const obj2 = Object.setPrototypeOf({});
// TypeError: Object.setPrototypeOf requires at least 2 arguments, but only 1 were passed
```


You can fix this by setting [`null`](../operators/null) as the
prototype, for example:

 
 
[js]


```js
const obj = Object.create(null);

const obj2 = Object.setPrototypeOf({}, null);
```
