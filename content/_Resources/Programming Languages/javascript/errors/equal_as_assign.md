SyntaxError: test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
===============================================================


The JavaScript warning \"test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment
(=)?\" occurs when there was an assignment (`=`) when you would normally
expect a test for equality (`==`).



Message
-------


```text
Warning: SyntaxError: test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
```




Error type 
----------


(Firefox only) [`SyntaxError`](../global_objects/syntaxerror) warning
which is reported only if `javascript.options.strict` preference is set
to `true`.




What went wrong? 
----------------


There was an assignment (`=`) when you would normally expect a test for
equality (`==`). To help debugging, JavaScript (with strict warnings
enabled) warns about this pattern.




Examples
--------



### Assignment within conditional expressions 


It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
expression (such as [`if...else`](../statements/if...else)), because the
assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code.
For example, do not use the following code:



[js]


```js
if (x = y) {
  // do the right thing
}
```


If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common
practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For
example:



[js]


```js
if ((x = y)) {
  // do the right thing
}
```


Otherwise, you probably meant to use a comparison operator (e.g. `==` or
`===`):



[js]


```js
if (x === y) {
  // do the right thing
}
```
