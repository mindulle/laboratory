TypeError: cannot use \'in\' operator to search for \'x\' in \'y\'
==================================================================

 
The JavaScript exception \"right-hand side of \'in\' should be an
object\" occurs when the [`in` operator](../operators/in) was used to
search in strings, or in numbers, or other primitive types. It can only
be used to check if a property is in an object.


 
Message
-------

 
```text
TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'x' in 'y' (V8-based & Firefox)
TypeError: right-hand side of 'in' should be an object, got null (Firefox)
TypeError: "y" is not an Object. (evaluating '"x" in "y"') (Safari)
```



 
Error type

[`TypeError`](../global_objects/typeerror)



 
What went wrong? 
----------------

 
The [`in` operator](../operators/in) can only be used to check if a
property is in an object. You can\'t search in strings, or in numbers,
or other primitive types.



 
Examples
--------


 
### Searching in strings 

 
Unlike in other programming languages (e.g. Python), you can\'t search
in strings using the [`in` operator](../operators/in).

 
 
[js]


```js
"Hello" in "Hello World";
// TypeError: cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'Hello' in 'Hello World'
```


Instead you will need to use
[`String.prototype.includes()`](../global_objects/string/includes), for
example.

 
 
[js]


```js
"Hello World".includes("Hello");
// true
```




 
### The operand can\'t be null or undefined 

 
Make sure the object you are inspecting isn\'t actually
[`null`](../operators/null) or
[`undefined`](../global_objects/undefined).

 
 
[js]


```js
const foo = null;
"bar" in foo;
// TypeError: cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'bar' in 'foo' (Chrome)
// TypeError: right-hand side of 'in' should be an object, got null (Firefox)
```


The `in` operator always expects an object.

 
 
[js]


```js
const foo = { baz: "bar" };
"bar" in foo; // false

"PI" in Math; // true
"pi" in Math; // false
```




 
### Searching in arrays 

 
Be careful when using the `in` operator to search in
[`Array`](../global_objects/array) objects. The `in` operator checks the
index number, not the value at that index.

 
 
[js]


```js
const trees = ["redwood", "bay", "cedar", "oak", "maple"];
3 in trees; // true
"oak" in trees; // false
```
