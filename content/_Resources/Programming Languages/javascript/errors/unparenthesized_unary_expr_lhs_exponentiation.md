SyntaxError: unparenthesized unary expression can\'t appear on the left-hand side of \'\*\*\'
=============================================================================================

 
The JavaScript exception \"unparenthesized unary expression can\'t
appear on the left-hand side of \'\*\*\'\" occurs when a unary operator
(one of `typeof`, `void`, `delete`, `await`, `!`, `~`, `+`, `-`) is used
on the left operand of the [exponentiation
operator](../operators/exponentiation) without parentheses.


 
Message
-------

 
```text
SyntaxError: Unary operator used immediately before exponentiation expression. Parenthesis must be used to disambiguate operator precedence (V8-based)
SyntaxError: unparenthesized unary expression can't appear on the left-hand side of '**' (Firefox)
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '**'. Ambiguous unary expression in the left hand side of the exponentiation expression; parentheses must be used to disambiguate the expression. (Safari)

What went wrong? 
----------------

 
You likely wrote something like this:

 
 
[js]


```js
-a ** b
```


Whether it should be evaluated as `(-a) ** b` or `-(a ** b)` is
ambiguous. In mathematics, -x^2^ means `-(x ** 2)` --- and that\'s how
many languages, including Python, Haskell, and PHP, handle it. But
making the unary minus operator take precedence over `**` breaks
symmetry with `a ** -b`, which is unambiguously `a ** (-b)`. Therefore,
the language forbids this syntax and requires you to parenthesize either
side to resolve the ambiguity.

 
 
[js]


```js
(-a) ** b
-(a ** b)
```


Other unary operators cannot be the left-hand side of exponentiation
either.

 
 
[js]


```js
await a ** b
!a ** b
+a ** b
~a ** b
```




 
Examples
--------

 
When writing complex math expressions involving exponentiation, you may
write something like this:

 
 
[js]


```js
function taylorSin(x) {
  return (n) => (-1 ** n * x ** (2 * n + 1)) / factorial(2 * n + 1);
  // SyntaxError: unparenthesized unary expression can't appear on the left-hand side of '**'
}
```


However, the `-1 ** n` part is illegal in JavaScript. Instead,
parenthesize the left operand:

 
 
[js]


```js
function taylorSin(x) {
  return (n) => ((-1) ** n * x ** (2 * n + 1)) / factorial(2 * n + 1);
}
```


This also makes the code\'s intent much clearer to other readers.
