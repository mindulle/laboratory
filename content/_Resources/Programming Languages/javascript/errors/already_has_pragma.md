Warning: -file- is being assigned a //\# sourceMappingURL, but already has one
==============================================================================


The JavaScript warning \"-file- is being assigned a //\#
sourceMappingURL, but already has one.\" occurs when a source map has
been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source.



Message
-------


```text
Warning: -file- is being assigned a //# sourceMappingURL, but already has one.
```




Error type 
----------


A warning. JavaScript execution won\'t be halted.




What went wrong? 
----------------


A source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript
source.

JavaScript sources are often combined and minified to make delivering
them from the server more efficient. With [source
maps](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/sourcemaps/), the debugger can
map the code being executed to the original source files. There are two
ways to assign a source map, either by using a comment or by setting a
header to the JavaScript file.




Examples
--------



### Setting source maps 


Setting a source map by using a comment in the file:



[js]


```js
//# sourceMappingURL=http://example.com/path/to/your/sourcemap.map
```


Or, alternatively, you can set a header to your JavaScript file:



[http]


```http
X-SourceMap: /path/to/file.js.map
```
