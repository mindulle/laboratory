SyntaxError: Unexpected \'\#\' used outside of class body
=========================================================


The JavaScript exception \"Unexpected \'\#\' used outside of class
body\" occurs when a hash (\"\#\") is encountered in an unexpected
context, most notably [](privateProperties.md). Hashes are valid at the
beginning of a file as a [hashbang comment](../lexical_grammar), or
inside of a class as part of a private field. You may encounter this
error if you forget the quotation marks when trying to access a DOM
identifier as well.



Message
-------


```text
SyntaxError: Unexpected '#' used outside of class body.
```




Error type 
----------


[`SyntaxError`](../global_objects/syntaxerror)




What went wrong? 
----------------


We encountered a `#` somewhere unexpected. This may be due to code
moving around and no longer being part of a class, a hashbang comment
found on a line other than the first line of a file, or accidentally
forgetting the quotation marks around a DOM identifier.




Examples
--------



### Missing quotation marks 


For each case, there might be something slightly wrong. For example



[js]


```js
document.querySelector(#some-element)
```


This can be fixed via



[js]


```js
document.querySelector("#some-element");
```





### Outside of a class 




[js]


```js
class ClassWithPrivateField {
  #privateField;

  constructor() {}
}

this.#privateField = 42;
```


This can be fixed by moving the private field back into the class



[js]


```js
class ClassWithPrivateField {
  #privateField;

  constructor() {
    this.#privateField = 42;
  }
}
```
