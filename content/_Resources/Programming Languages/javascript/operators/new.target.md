new.target
==========

 
The `new.target` meta-property lets you detect whether a function or
constructor was called using the [`new`](new) operator. In constructors
and functions invoked using the [`new`](new) operator, `new.target`
returns a reference to the constructor or function that `new` was called
upon. In normal function calls, `new.target` is
[`undefined`](../global_objects/undefined).

Syntax

[js]


```js
new.target
```




 
### Value

 
`new.target` is guaranteed to be a constructable function value or
`undefined`.

-   In class constructors, it refers to the class that `new` was called
    upon, which may be a subclass of the current constructor, because
    subclasses transitively call the superclass\'s constructor through
    [`super()`](super).
-   In ordinary functions, if the function is constructed directly with
    [`new`](new), `new.target` refers to the function itself. If the
    function is called without `new`, `new.target` is
    [`undefined`](../global_objects/undefined). Functions can be used as
    the base class for [`extends`](../classes/extends), in which case
    `new.target` may refer to the subclass.
-   If a constructor (class or function) is called via
    [`Reflect.construct()`](../global_objects/reflect/construct), then
    `new.target` refers to the value passed as `newTarget` (which
    defaults to `target`).
-   In [arrow functions](../functions/arrow_functions), `new.target` is
    inherited from the surrounding scope. If the arrow function is not
    defined within another class or function which has a `new.target`
    [binding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Binding),
    then a syntax error is thrown.
-   In [static initialization
    blocks](../classes/static_initialization_blocks), `new.target` is
    [`undefined`](../global_objects/undefined).



 
Description
-----------

 
The `new.target` syntax consists of the keyword `new`, a dot, and the
identifier `target`. Because `new` is a [reserved
word](../lexical_grammar#reserved_words), not an identifier, this is not
a [property accessor](property_accessors), but a special expression
syntax.

The `new.target` meta-property is available in all function/class
bodies; using `new.target` outside of functions or classes is a syntax
error.



 
Examples
--------


 
### new.target in function calls 

 
In normal function calls (as opposed to constructor function calls),
`new.target` is [`undefined`](../global_objects/undefined). This lets
you detect whether a function was called with [`new`](new) as a
constructor.

 
 
[js]


```js
function Foo() {
  if (!new.target) {
    throw new Error("Foo() must be called with new");
  }
  console.log("Foo instantiated with new");
}

new Foo(); // Logs "Foo instantiated with new"
Foo(); // Throws "Foo() must be called with new"
```




 
### new.target in constructors 

 
In class constructors, `new.target` refers to the constructor that was
directly invoked by `new`. This is also the case if the constructor is
in a parent class and was delegated from a child constructor.
`new.target` points to the class that `new` was called upon. For
example, when `b` was initialized using `new B()`, the name of `B` was
printed; and similarly, in case of `a`, the name of class `A` was
printed.

 
 
[js]


```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    console.log(new.target.name);
  }
}

class B extends A {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}

const a = new A(); // Logs "A"
const b = new B(); // Logs "B"
```




 
### new.target using Reflect.construct() 

 
Before [`Reflect.construct()`](../global_objects/reflect/construct) or
classes, it was common to implement inheritance by passing the value of
[`this`](this), and letting the base constructor mutate it.

 
 
[js]


```js
function Base() {
  this.name = "Base";
}

function Extended() {
  // Only way to make the Base() constructor work on the existing
  // `this` value instead of a new object that `new` creates.
  Base.call(this);
  this.otherProperty = "Extended";
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(Extended.prototype, Base.prototype);
Object.setPrototypeOf(Extended, Base);

console.log(new Extended()); // Extended { name: 'Base', otherProperty: 'Extended' }
```


However, [`call()`](../global_objects/function/call) and
[`apply()`](../global_objects/function/apply) actually *call* the
function instead of *constructing* it, so `new.target` has value
`undefined`. This means that if `Base()` checks whether it\'s
constructed with `new`, an error will be thrown, or it may behave in
other unexpected ways. For example, you can\'t extend
[`Map`](../global_objects/map/map) this way, because the `Map()`
constructor cannot be called without `new`.

All built-in constructors directly construct the entire prototype chain
of the new instance by reading `new.target.prototype`. So to make sure
that (1) `Base` is constructed with `new`, and (2) `new.target` points
to the subclass instead of `Base` itself, we need to use
[`Reflect.construct()`](../global_objects/reflect/construct).

 
 
[js]


```js
function BetterMap(entries) {
  // Call the base class constructor, but setting `new.target` to the subclass,
  // so that the instance created has the correct prototype chain.
  return Reflect.construct(Map, [entries], BetterMap);
}

BetterMap.prototype.upsert = function (key, actions) {
  if (this.has(key)) {
    this.set(key, actions.update(this.get(key)));
  } else {
    this.set(key, actions.insert());
  }
};

Object.setPrototypeOf(BetterMap.prototype, Map.prototype);
Object.setPrototypeOf(BetterMap, Map);

const map = new BetterMap([["a", 1]]);
map.upsert("a", {
  update: (value) => value + 1,
  insert: () => 1,
});
console.log(map.get("a")); // 2
```


 
**Note:** In fact, due to the lack of `Reflect.construct()`, it is not
possible to properly subclass built-ins (like [`Error`
subclassing](../global_objects/error#custom_error_types)) when
transpiling to pre-ES6 code.


However, if you are writing ES6 code, prefer using classes and `extends`
instead, as it\'s more readable and less error-prone.

 
 
[js]


```js
class BetterMap extends Map {
  // The constructor is omitted because it's just the default one

  upsert(key, actions) {
    if (this.has(key)) {
      this.set(key, actions.update(this.get(key)));
    } else {
      this.set(key, actions.insert());
    }
  }
}

const map = new BetterMap([["a", 1]]);
map.upsert("a", {
  update: (value) => value + 1,
  insert: () => 1,
});
console.log(map.get("a")); // 2
```
