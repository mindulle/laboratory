Grouping operator ( )
=====================

 
The `( )` operator controls the precedence of evaluation in expressions.
It also acts as a container for arbitrary expressions in certain
syntactic constructs, where ambiguity or syntax errors would otherwise
occur.

Syntax
------

 
 
 
[js]


```js
(expression)
```




 
### Parameters

 

[`expression`](#expression)

:   Any
    [expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators)
    to be evaluated, including [comma-joined](comma_operator)
    expressions.



 
Description
-----------

 
The grouping operator consists of a pair of parentheses around an
expression that groups the contents. The operator overrides the normal
[operator precedence](operator_precedence), so that operators with lower
precedence (as low as the [comma](comma_operator) operator) can be
evaluated before an operator with higher precedence.



 
Examples
--------


 
### Using the grouping operator 

 
Evaluating addition and subtraction before multiplication and division.

 
 
[js]


```js
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = 3;

// default precedence
a + b * c; // 7
// evaluated by default like this
a + (b * c); // 7

// now overriding precedence
// addition before multiplication
(a + b) * c; // 9

// which is equivalent to
a * c + b * c; // 9
```


Notice in these examples that the order in which the *operators*
evaluate has changed, but the order in which the *operands* evaluate has
not. For example, in this code, the function invocations `a()`, `b()`,
and `c()` are evaluated left-to-right (the normal order of evaluation)
before the operator order is considered.

 
 
[js]


```js
a() * (b() + c());
```


The function `a` will be called before the function `b`, which will be
called before the function `c`. For more on operator precedence, see its
[reference page](operator_precedence).



 
### Using the grouping operator to eliminate parsing ambiguity 

 
An [expression statement](../statements/expression_statement) cannot
start with the keyword `function`, because the parser would see it as
the start of a [function declaration](../statements/function). This
means the following
[IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) syntax is
invalid:

 
 
[js]


```js
function () {
  // code
}();
```


The grouping operator can be used to eliminate this ambiguity, since
when the parser sees the left parenthesis, it knows that what follows
must be an expression instead of a declaration.

 
 
[js]


```js
(function () {
  // code
})();
```


You may also use the
[`void`](void#immediately_invoked_function_expressions) operator to
eliminate ambiguity.

In an [arrow function](../functions/arrow_functions) expression body
(one that directly returns an expression without the keyword `return`),
the grouping operator can be used to return an object literal
expression, because otherwise the left curly brace would be interpreted
as the start of the function body.

 
 
[js]


```js
const f = () => ({ a: 1 });
```


If a property is accessed on a number literal, the [property
accessor](property_accessors) dot `.` may be ambiguous with a decimal
point, unless the number already has a decimal point. You can wrap
integer literals in parentheses to eliminate this ambiguity.

 
 
[js]


```js
(1).toString(); // "1"
```




 
### Grouping operator and automatic semicolon insertion 

 
The grouping operator can mitigate [automatic semicolon
insertion](../lexical_grammar#automatic_semicolon_insertion) (ASI)
pitfalls. For example, the `return` keyword and the returned expression
cannot have a line break in between:

 
 
[js]


```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return
    a + b;
}
```


This code will return `undefined`, because a semicolon is inserted
directly after the `return` keyword, which causes the function to return
immediately without evaluating `a + b`. In case the returned expression
is long and you want to keep it well-formatted, you may use the grouping
operator to signify that the `return` keyword is followed by an
expression and prevent semicolon insertion:

 
 
[js]


```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return (
    a + b
  );
}
```


However, grouping may also *introduce* ASI hazards. When a line starts
with a left parenthesis and the previous line ends with an expression,
the parser will not insert a semicolon before the line break, because it
could be the middle of a function call. For example:

 
 
[js]


```js
const a = 1
(1).toString()
```


This code would be parsed as:

 
 
[js]


```js
const a = 1(1).toString();
```


Which throws \"TypeError: 1 is not a function\". If your coding style
does not use semicolons, remember that when a line starts with a left
parenthesis, *prefix* it with a semicolon. This practice is recommended
by several formatters and/or style guides, including
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale.html#semicolons) and
[standard](https://standardjs.com/rules.html#semicolons).

 
 
[js]


```js
const a = 1
;(1).toString()
```


For more advice on working with ASI, see its [reference
section](../lexical_grammar#automatic_semicolon_insertion).
