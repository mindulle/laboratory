Capturing group: (\...)
=======================

 
A **capturing group** groups a subpattern, allowing you to apply a
[quantifier](quantifier) to the entire group or use
[disjunctions](disjunction) within it. It memorizes information about
the subpattern match, so that you can refer back to it later with a
[backreference](backreference), or access the information through the
[match results](../global_objects/regexp/exec#return_value).

If you don\'t need the result of the subpattern match, use a
[non-capturing group](non-capturing_group) instead, which improves
performance and avoids refactoring hazards.


 
Syntax
------

 
 
 
[regex]


```regex
(pattern)
```




 
### Parameters

 

[`pattern`](#pattern)

:   A pattern consisting of anything you may use in a regex literal,
    including a [disjunction](disjunction).



 
Description
-----------

 
A capturing group acts like the [grouping
operator](../operators/grouping) in JavaScript expressions, allowing you
to use a subpattern as a single [atom](../regular_expressions#atoms).

Capturing groups are numbered by the order of their opening parentheses.
The first capturing group is numbered `1`, the second `2`, and so on.
[Named capturing groups](named_capturing_group) are also capturing
groups and are numbered together with other (unnamed) capturing groups.
The information of the capturing group\'s match can be accessed through:

-   The return value (which is an array) of
    [`RegExp.prototype.exec()`](../global_objects/regexp/exec),
    [`String.prototype.match()`](../global_objects/string/match), and
    [`String.prototype.matchAll()`](../global_objects/string/matchall)
-   The `pN` parameters of the
    [`String.prototype.replace()`](../global_objects/string/replace) and
    [`String.prototype.replaceAll()`](../global_objects/string/replaceall)
    methods\' `replacement` callback function
-   [Backreferences](backreference) within the same pattern

 
**Note:** Even in `exec()`\'s result array, capturing groups are
accessed by numbers `1`, `2`, etc., because the `0` element is the
entire match. `\0` is not a backreference, but a [character
escape](character_escape) for the NUL character.


Capturing groups in the regex source code correspond to their results
one-to-one. If a capturing group is not matched (for example, it belongs
to an unmatched alternative in a [disjunction](disjunction)), the
corresponding result is `undefined`.

 
 
[js]


```js
/(ab)|(cd)/.exec("cd"); // ['cd', undefined, 'cd']
```


Capturing groups can be [quantified](quantifier). In this case, the
match information corresponding to this group is the last match of the
group.

 
 
[js]


```js
/([ab])+/.exec("abc"); // ['ab', 'b']; because "b" comes after "a", this result overwrites the previous one
```


Capturing groups can be used in [lookahead](lookahead_assertion) and
[lookbehind](lookbehind_assertion) assertions. Because lookbehind
assertions match their atoms backwards, the final match corresponding to
this group is the one that appears to the *left* end of the string.
However, the indices of the match groups still correspond to their
relative locations in the regex source.

 
 
[js]


```js
/c(?=(ab))/.exec("cab"); // ['c', 'ab']
/(?<=(a)(b))c/.exec("abc"); // ['c', 'a', 'b']
/(?<=([ab])+)c/.exec("abc"); // ['c', 'a']; because "a" is seen by the lookbehind after the lookbehind has seen "b"
```


Capturing groups can be nested, in which case the outer group is
numbered first, then the inner group, because they are ordered by their
opening parentheses. If a nested group is repeated by a quantifier, then
each time the group matches, the subgroups\' results are all
overwritten, sometimes with `undefined`.

 
 
[js]


```js
/((a+)?(b+)?(c))*/.exec("aacbbbcac"); // ['aacbbbcac', 'ac', 'a', undefined, 'c']
```


In the example above, the outer group is matched three times:

1.  Matches `"aac"`, with subgroups `"aa"`, `undefined`, and `"c"`.
2.  Matches `"bbbc"`, with subgroups `undefined`, `"bbb"`, and `"c"`.
3.  Matches `"ac"`, with subgroups `"a"`, `undefined`, and `"c"`.

The `"bbb"` result from the second match is not preserved, because the
third match overwrites it with `undefined`.

You can get the start and end indices of each capturing group in the
input string by using the [`d`](../global_objects/regexp/hasindices)
flag. This creates an extra `indices` property on the array returned by
`exec()`.

You can optionally specify a name to a capturing group, which helps
avoid pitfalls related to group positions and indexing. See [Named
capturing groups](named_capturing_group) for more information.

Parentheses have other purposes in different regex syntaxes. For
example, they also enclose lookahead and lookbehind assertions. Because
these syntaxes all start with `?`, and `?` is a [quantifier](quantifier)
which normally cannot occur directly after `(`, this does not lead to
ambiguities.



 
Examples
--------


 
### Matching date 

 
The following example matches a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`:

 
 
[js]


```js
function parseDate(input) {
  const parts = /^(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})$/.exec(input);
  if (!parts) {
    return null;
  }
  return parts.slice(1).map((p) => parseInt(p, 10));
}

parseDate("2019-01-01"); // [2019, 1, 1]
parseDate("2019-06-19"); // [2019, 6, 19]
```




 
### Pairing quotes 

 
The following function matches the `title='xxx'` and `title="xxx"`
patterns in a string. To ensure the quotes match, we use a backreference
to refer to the first quote. Accessing the second capturing group
(`[2]`) returns the string between the matching quote characters:

 
 
[js]


```js
function parseTitle(metastring) {
  return metastring.match(/title=(["'])(.*?)\1/)[2];
}

parseTitle('title="foo"'); // 'foo'
parseTitle("title='foo' lang='en'"); // 'foo'
parseTitle('title="Named capturing groups\' advantages"'); // "Named capturing groups' advantages"
```
