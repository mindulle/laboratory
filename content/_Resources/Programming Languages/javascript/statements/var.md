var
===

 
The `var` statement declares function-scoped or globally-scoped
variables, optionally initializing each to a value.

Syntax
------

 
 
 
[js]


```js
var name1;
var name1 = value1;
var name1 = value1, name2 = value2;
var name1, name2 = value2;
var name1 = value1, name2, /* â€¦, */ nameN = valueN;
```


[`nameN`](#namen)

:   The name of the variable to declare. Each must be a legal JavaScript
    [identifier](../lexical_grammar#identifiers) or a [destructuring
    binding pattern](../operators/destructuring_assignment).

[`valueN`](#valuen) [Optional]

:   Initial value of the variable. It can be any legal expression.
    Default value is `undefined`.



 
Description
-----------

 
The scope of a variable declared with `var` is one of the following
curly-brace-enclosed syntaxes that most closely contains the `var`
statement:

-   Function body
-   [Static initialization
    block](../classes/static_initialization_blocks)

Or if none of the above applies:

-   The current
    [module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules),
    for code running in module mode
-   The global scope, for code running in script mode.

 
 
[js]


```js
function foo() {
  var x = 1;
  function bar() {
    var y = 2;
    console.log(x); // 1 (function `bar` closes over `x`)
    console.log(y); // 2 (`y` is in scope)
  }
  bar();
  console.log(x); // 1 (`x` is in scope)
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError, `y` is scoped to `bar`
}

foo();
```


Importantly, other block constructs, including [block
statements](block), [`try...catch`](try...catch), [`switch`](switch),
headers of [one of the `for`
statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements#iterations),
do not create scopes for `var`, and variables declared with `var` inside
such a block can continue to be referenced outside the block.

 
 
[js]


```js
for (var a of [1, 2, 3]);
console.log(a); // 3
```


In a script, a variable declared using `var` is added as a
non-configurable property of the global object. This means its property
descriptor cannot be changed and it cannot be deleted using
[`delete`](../operators/delete). JavaScript has automatic memory
management, and it would make no sense to be able to use the `delete`
operator on a global variable.

 
 
[js]


```js
"use strict";
var x = 1;
Object.hasOwn(globalThis, "x"); // true
delete globalThis.x; // TypeError in strict mode. Fails silently otherwise.
delete x; // SyntaxError in strict mode. Fails silently otherwise.
```


In both NodeJS [CommonJS](https://www.commonjs.org/) modules and native
[ECMAScript
modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules),
top-level variable declarations are scoped to the module, and are not
added as properties to the global object.

The list that follows the `var` keyword is called a
*[binding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Binding)
list* and is separated by commas, where the commas are *not* [comma
operators](../operators/comma_operator) and the `=` signs are *not*
[assignment operators](../operators/assignment). Initializers of later
variables can refer to earlier variables in the list and get the
initialized value.



 
### Hoisting

 
`var` declarations, wherever they occur in a script, are processed
before any code within the script is executed. Declaring a variable
anywhere in the code is equivalent to declaring it at the top. This also
means that a variable can appear to be used before it\'s declared. This
behavior is called
[*hoisting*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting),
as it appears that the variable declaration is moved to the top of the
function, static initialization block, or script source in which it
occurs.

 
**Note:** `var` declarations are only hoisted to the top of the current
script. If you have two `<script>` elements within one HTML, the first
script cannot access variables declared by the second before the second
script has been processed and executed.


 
 
[js]


```js
bla = 2;
var bla;
```


This is implicitly understood as:

 
 
[js]


```js
var bla;
bla = 2;
```


For that reason, it is recommended to always declare variables at the
top of their scope (the top of global code and the top of function code)
so it\'s clear which variables are scoped to the current function.

Only a variable\'s declaration is hoisted, not its initialization. The
initialization happens only when the assignment statement is reached.
Until then the variable remains `undefined` (but declared):

 
 
[js]


```js
function doSomething() {
  console.log(bar); // undefined
  var bar = 111;
  console.log(bar); // 111
}
```


This is implicitly understood as:

 
 
[js]


```js
function doSomething() {
  var bar;
  console.log(bar); // undefined
  bar = 111;
  console.log(bar); // 111
}
```




 
### Redeclarations

 
Duplicate variable declarations using `var` will not trigger an error,
even in strict mode, and the variable will not lose its value, unless
the declaration has an initializer.

 
 
[js]


```js
var a = 1;
var a = 2;
console.log(a); // 2
var a;
console.log(a); // 2; not undefined
```


`var` declarations can also be in the same scope as a `function`
declaration. In this case, the `var` declaration\'s initializer always
overrides the function\'s value, regardless of their relative position.
This is because function declarations are hoisted before any initializer
gets evaluated, so the initializer comes later and overrides the value.

 
 
[js]


```js
var a = 1;
function a() {}
console.log(a); // 1
```


`var` declarations cannot be in the same scope as a [`let`](let),
[`const`](const), [`class`](class), or [`import`](import) declaration.

 
 
[js]


```js
var a = 1;
let a = 2; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
```


Because `var` declarations are not scoped to blocks, this also applies
to the following case:

 
 
[js]


```js
let a = 1;
{
  var a = 1; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
}
```


It does not apply to the following case, where `let` is in a child scope
of `var`, not the same scope:

 
 
[js]


```js
var a = 1;
{
  let a = 2;
}
```


A `var` declaration within a function\'s body can have the same name as
a parameter.

 
 
[js]


```js
function foo(a) {
  var a = 1;
  console.log(a);
}

foo(2); // Logs 1
```


A `var` declaration within a `catch` block can have the same name as the
`catch`-bound identifier, but only if the `catch` binding is a simple
identifier, not a destructuring pattern. This is a [deprecated
syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Deprecated_and_obsolete_features#statements)
and you should not rely on it. In this case, the declaration is hoisted
to outside the `catch` block, but any value assigned within the `catch`
block is not visible outside.

 
 
[js]


```js
try {
  throw 1;
} catch (e) {
  var e = 2; // Works
}
console.log(e); // undefined
```




 
Examples
--------


 
### Declaring and initializing two variables 

 
 
 
[js]


```js
var a = 0,
  b = 0;
```




 
### Assigning two variables with single string value 

 
 
 
[js]


```js
var a = "A";
var b = a;
```


This is equivalent to:

 
 
[js]


```js
var a, b = a = "A";
```


Be mindful of the order:

 
 
[js]


```js
var x = y,
  y = "A";
console.log(x, y); // undefined A
```


Here, `x` and `y` are declared before any code is executed, but the
assignments occur later. At the time `x = y` is evaluated, `y` exists so
no `ReferenceError` is thrown and its value is `undefined`. So, `x` is
assigned the undefined value. Then, `y` is assigned the value `"A"`.



 
### Initialization of several variables 

 
Be careful of the `var x = y = 1` syntax --- `y` is not actually
declared as a variable, so `y = 1` is an [unqualified identifier
assignment](../operators/assignment#unqualified_identifier_assignment),
which creates a global variable in non-strict mode.

 
 
[js]


```js
var x = 0;
function f() {
  var x = y = 1; // Declares x locally; declares y globally.
}
f();

console.log(x, y); // 0 1

// In non-strict mode:
// x is the global one as expected;
// y is leaked outside of the function, though!
```


The same example as above but with a strict mode:

 
 
[js]


```js
"use strict";

var x = 0;
function f() {
  var x = y = 1; // ReferenceError: y is not defined
}
f();

console.log(x, y);
```




 
### Implicit globals and outer function scope 

 
Variables that appear to be implicit globals may be references to
variables in an outer function scope:

 
 
[js]


```js
var x = 0; // Declares x within file scope, then assigns it a value of 0.

console.log(typeof z); // "undefined", since z doesn't exist yet

function a() {
  var y = 2; // Declares y within scope of function a, then assigns it a value of 2.

  console.log(x, y); // 0 2

  function b() {
    x = 3; // Assigns 3 to existing file scoped x.
    y = 4; // Assigns 4 to existing outer y.
    z = 5; // Creates a new global variable z, and assigns it a value of 5.
    // (Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode.)
  }

  b(); // Creates z as a global variable.
  console.log(x, y, z); // 3 4 5
}

a(); // Also calls b.
console.log(x, z); // 3 5
console.log(typeof y); // "undefined", as y is local to function a
```




 
### Declaration with destructuring 

 
The left-hand side of each `=` can also be a binding pattern. This
allows creating multiple variables at once.

 
 
[js]


```js
const result = /(a+)(b+)(c+)/.exec("aaabcc");
var [, a, b, c] = result;
console.log(a, b, c); // "aaa" "b" "cc"
```

assignment](../operators/destructuring_assignment).
