Description
-----------

 
`Number.EPSILON` is the difference between 1 and the next greater number
representable in the Number format, because [double precision floating
point
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format)
only has 52 bits to represent the [mantissa](../number#number_encoding),
and the lowest bit has a significance of 2^-52^.

Note that the absolute accuracy of floating numbers decreases as the
number gets larger, because the exponent grows while the mantissa\'s
accuracy stays the same. [`Number.MIN_VALUE`](min_value) is the smallest
representable positive number, which is much smaller than
`Number.EPSILON`.

Because `EPSILON` is a static property of [`Number`](../number), you
always use it as `Number.EPSILON`, rather than as a property of a number
value.



 
Examples
--------


 
### Testing equality 

 
Any number encoding system occupying a finite number of bits, of
whatever base you choose (e.g. decimal or binary), will *necessarily* be
unable to represent all numbers exactly, because you are trying to
represent an infinite number of points on the number line using a finite
amount of memory. For example, a base-10 (decimal) system cannot
represent 1/3 exactly, and a base-2 (binary) system cannot represent
`0.1` exactly. Thus, for example, `0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly equal to
`0.3`:

 
 
[js]


```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); // false
```


For this reason, it is often advised that `===`. Instead, we can deem
two numbers as equal if they are *close enough* to each other. The
`Number.EPSILON` constant is usually a reasonable threshold for errors
if the arithmetic is around the magnitude of `1`, because `EPSILON`, in
essence, specifies how accurate the number \"1\" is.

 
 
[js]


```js
function equal(x, y) {
  return Math.abs(x - y) < Number.EPSILON;
}

const x = 0.2;
const y = 0.3;
const z = 0.1;
console.log(equal(x + z, y)); // true
```


However, `Number.EPSILON` is inappropriate for any arithmetic operating
on a larger magnitude. If your data is on the 10^3^ order of magnitude,
the decimal part will have a much smaller accuracy than
`Number.EPSILON`:

 
 
[js]


```js
function equal(x, y) {
  return Math.abs(x - y) < Number.EPSILON;
}

const x = 1000.1;
const y = 1000.2;
const z = 2000.3;
console.log(x + y); // 2000.3000000000002; error of 10^-13 instead of 10^-16
console.log(equal(x + y, z)); // false
```


In this case, a larger tolerance is required. As the numbers compared
have a magnitude of approximately `2000`, a multiplier such as
`2000 * Number.EPSILON` creates enough tolerance for this instance.

 
 
[js]


```js
function equal(x, y, tolerance = Number.EPSILON) {
  return Math.abs(x - y) < tolerance;
}

const x = 1000.1;
const y = 1000.2;
const z = 2000.3;
console.log(equal(x + y, z, 2000 * Number.EPSILON)); // true
```


In addition to magnitude, it is important to consider the *accuracy* of
your input. For example, if the numbers are collected from a form input
and the input value can only be adjusted by steps of `0.1` (i.e.
[`<input type="number" step="0.1">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/step)),
it usually makes sense to allow a much larger tolerance, such as `0.01`,
since the data only has a precision of `0.1`.

 
**Note:** Important takeaway: do not simply use `Number.EPSILON` as a
threshold for equality testing. Use a threshold that is appropriate for
the magnitude and accuracy of the numbers you are comparing.
