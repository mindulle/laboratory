Intl.Locale.prototype.getHourCycles()
=====================================

 
The `getHourCycles()` method of [`Intl.Locale`](../locale) instances
returns a list of one or more unique hour cycle identifiers for this
locale.

 
**Note:** In some versions of some browsers, this method was implemented
as an accessor property called `hourCycles`. However, because it returns
a new array on each access, it is now implemented as a method to prevent
the situation of `locale.hourCycles === locale.hourCycles` returning
`false`. Check the [browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility)
for details.



 
Syntax
------

 
 
 
[js]


```js
getHourCycles()
```




 
### Parameters

 
None.



 
### Return value 

 
An array of strings representing all hour cycle types commonly used for
the `Locale`, sorted in descending preference. If the `Locale` already
has an [`hourCycle`](hourcycle), then the returned array contains that
single value.

Below is a list of supported hour cycle types.



 
### Supported hour cycle types 

 

[`h12`](#h12)

:   Hour system using 1--12; corresponds to \'h\' in patterns. The 12
    hour clock, with midnight starting at 12:00 am. As used, for
    example, in the United States.

[`h23`](#h23)

:   Hour system using 0--23; corresponds to \'H\' in patterns. The 24
    hour clock, with midnight starting at 0:00.

[`h11`](#h11)

:   Hour system using 0--11; corresponds to \'K\' in patterns. The 12
    hour clock, with midnight starting at 0:00 am. Mostly used in Japan.

[`h24`](#h24)

:   Hour system using 1--24; corresponds to \'k\' in pattern. The 24
    hour clock, with midnight starting at 24:00. Not used anywhere.



 
Examples
--------


 
### Obtaining supported hour cycles 

 
If the `Locale` object doesn\'t have a `hourCycle` already,
`getHourCycles()` lists all commonly-used collation types for the given
`Locale`. For examples of explicitly setting a `hourCycle`, see
[`hourCycle` examples](hourcycle#examples).

 
 
[js]


```js
const arEG = new Intl.Locale("ar-EG");
console.log(arEG.getHourCycles()); // ["h12"]
```


 
 
[js]


```js
const jaJP = new Intl.Locale("ja-JP");
console.log(jaJP.getHourCycles()); // ["h23"]
```
