Intl.Locale.prototype.getCollations()
=====================================

 
The `getCollations()` method of [`Intl.Locale`](../locale) instances
returns a list of one or more [collation
types](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#CLDR_collation)
for this locale.

 
**Note:** In some versions of some browsers, this method was implemented
as an accessor property called `collations`. However, because it returns
a new array on each access, it is now implemented as a method to prevent
the situation of `locale.collations === locale.collations` returning
`false`. Check the [browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility)
for details.



 
Syntax
------

 
 
 
[js]


```js
getCollations()
```




 
### Parameters

 
None.



 
### Return value 

 
An array of strings representing all collation types commonly used for
the `Locale`, sorted in alphabetical order, with the `standard` and
`search` values always excluded. If the `Locale` already has a
[`collation`](collation), then the returned array contains that single
value.

Below is a list of the supported collation types, adapted from the
[Unicode collation
specification](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/2dd06669d833823e26872f249aa304bc9d9d2a90/common/bcp47/collation.xml).



 
### Supported collation types 

 

[`big5han`](#big5han)

:   Pinyin ordering for Latin, big5 charset ordering for CJK characters
    (for Chinese)

     
    **Warning:** The `big5han` collation type is deprecated, not
    available in Firefox, Chrome or Edge.
    

[`compat`](#compat)

:   A previous version of the ordering, for compatibility (for Arabic)

[`dict`](#dict)

:   Dictionary style ordering (for Sinhala)

[`direct`](#direct)

:   Binary code point order

     
    **Warning:** The `direct` collation type has been deprecated. Do not
    use.
    

[`ducet`](#ducet)

:   The default Unicode collation element table order

     
    **Warning:** The `ducet` collation type is not available to the Web.
    Use the `und` locale without a collation type specifier instead.
    `und` is the collation that is the closest to `ducet`.
    

[`emoji`](#emoji)

:   Recommended ordering for emoji characters (for the `und` locale)

[`eor`](#eor)

:   European ordering rules (for the `und` locale)

[`gb2312`](#gb2312)

:   Pinyin ordering for Latin, gb2312han charset ordering for CJK
    characters (for Chinese)

     
    **Warning:** The `gb2312` collation type is deprecated, not
    available in Firefox, Chrome or Edge.
    

[`phonebk`](#phonebk)

:   Phonebook style ordering (for German)

[`phonetic`](#phonetic)

:   Phonetic ordering (sorting based on pronunciation; for Lingala)

[`pinyin`](#pinyin)

:   Pinyin ordering for Latin and for CJK characters (for Chinese)

[`reformed`](#reformed)

:   Reformed ordering (formerly for Swedish)

     
    **Warning:** Do not use explicitly. This is the old name for the
    default ordering for Swedish [whose collation naming used to differ
    from other
    languages](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-15603).
    Since this was the default, request `sv` instead of requesting
    `sv-u-co-reformed`.
    

[`search`](#search)

:   Special collation type for string search

     
    **Warning:** Do not use as a collation type, since in
    [`Intl.Collator`](../collator), this collation is activated via the
    `"search"` value for the `usage` option. There is currently no API
    for substring search, so this is currently only good for filtering a
    list of strings by trying a full-string match of the key against
    each list item.
    

[`searchjl`](#searchjl)

:   Special collation type for Korean initial consonant search

     
    **Warning:** This collation is not for sorting, even though it is
    made available through [`Intl.Collator`](../collator) instantiated
    with usage `"sort"` as opposed to usage `"search"`.
    

[`standard`](#standard)

:   Default ordering for each language, except Chinese (and, previously,
    Swedish)

     
    **Warning:** Do not use explicitly. In general, it\'s unnecessary to
    specify this explicitly and specifying this for Swedish is
    problematic due to the different meaning for Swedish in the past.
    

[`stroke`](#stroke)

:   Pinyin ordering for Latin, stroke order for CJK characters (for
    Chinese)

[`trad`](#trad)

:   Traditional style ordering (such as in Spanish)

[`unihan`](#unihan)

:   Radical-stroke ordering for Han characters (for Chinese, Japanese,
    and Korean). Pinyin ordering for Latin in the case of Chinese.

     
    **Note:** The `unihan` collation type is not available in Chrome or
    Edge.
    

[`zhuyin`](#zhuyin)

:   Pinyin ordering for Latin, zhuyin order for Bopomofo and CJK
    characters (for Chinese)



 
Examples
--------


 
### Obtaining supported collation types 

 
If the `Locale` object doesn\'t have a `collation` already,
`getCollations()` lists all commonly-used collation types for the given
`Locale`. For examples of explicitly setting a `collation`, see
[`collation` examples](collation#examples).

 
 
[js]


```js
const locale = new Intl.Locale("zh");
console.log(locale.getCollations()); // ["pinyin", "stroke", "zhuyin", "emoji", "eor"]
```
