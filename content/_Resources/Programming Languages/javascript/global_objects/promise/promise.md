Promise() constructor
=====================

 
The `Promise()` constructor creates [`Promise`](../promise) objects. It
is primarily used to wrap callback-based APIs that do not already
support promises.


 
Try it 
------

 



 
Syntax
------

 
 
 
[js]


```js
new Promise(executor)
```


 
**Note:** `Promise()` can only be constructed with
[`new`](../../operators/new). Attempting to call it without `new` throws
a [`TypeError`](../typeerror).




 
### Parameters

 

[`executor`](#executor)

:   A [`function`](../function) to be executed by the constructor. It
    receives two functions as parameters: `resolveFunc` and
    `rejectFunc`. Any errors thrown in the `executor` will cause the
    promise to be rejected, and the return value will be neglected. The
    semantics of `executor` are detailed below.



 
### Return value 

 
When called via `new`, the `Promise` constructor returns a promise
object. The promise object will become *resolved* when either of the
functions `resolveFunc` or `rejectFunc` are invoked. Note that if you
call `resolveFunc` or `rejectFunc` and pass another `Promise` object as
an argument, it can be said to be \"resolved\", but still not
\"settled\". See the [Promise description](../promise#description) for
more explanation.



 
Description
-----------

 
Traditionally (before promises), asynchronous tasks were designed as
callbacks.

 
 
[js]


```js
readFile("./data.txt", (error, result) => {
  // This callback will be called when the task is done, with the
  // final `error` or `result`. Any operation dependent on the
  // result must be defined within this callback.
});
// Code here is immediately executed after the `readFile` request
// is fired. It does not wait for the callback to be called, hence
// making `readFile` "asynchronous".
```


To take advantage of the readability improvement and language features
offered by promises, the `Promise()` constructor allows one to transform
the callback-based API to a promise-based one.

 
**Note:** If your task is already promise-based, you likely do not need
the `Promise()` constructor.


The `executor` is custom code that ties an outcome in a callback to a
promise. You, the programmer, write the `executor`. Its signature is
expected to be:

 
 
[js]


```js
function executor(resolveFunc, rejectFunc) {
  // Typically, some asynchronous operation that accepts a callback,
  // like the `readFile` function above
}
```


`resolveFunc` and `rejectFunc` are also functions, and you can give them
whatever actual names you want. Their signatures are simple: they accept
a single parameter of any type.

 
 
[js]


```js
resolveFunc(value); // call on resolved
rejectFunc(reason); // call on rejected
```


The `value` parameter passed to `resolveFunc` can be another promise
object, in which case the newly constructed promise\'s state will be
\"locked in\" to the promise passed (as part of the
[resolution](#the_resolve_function) promise). The `rejectFunc` has
semantics close to the [`throw`](../../statements/throw) statement, so
`reason` is typically an [`Error`](../error) instance. If either `value`
or `reason` is omitted, the promise is fulfilled/rejected with
`undefined`.

The `executor`\'s completion state has limited effect on the promise\'s
state:

-   The `executor` return value is ignored. `return` statements within
    the `executor` merely impact control flow and alter whether a part
    of the function is executed, but do not have any impact on the
    promise\'s fulfillment value. If `executor` exits and it\'s
    impossible for `resolveFunc` or `rejectFunc` to be called in the
    future (for example, there are no async tasks scheduled), then the
    promise remains pending forever.
-   If an error is thrown in the `executor`, the promise is rejected,
    unless `resolveFunc` or `rejectFunc` has already been called.

 
**Note:** The existence of pending promises does not prevent the program
from exiting. If the event loop is empty, the program exits despite any
pending promises (because those are necessarily forever-pending).


Here\'s a summary of the typical flow:

1.  At the time when the constructor generates the new `Promise` object,
    it also generates a corresponding pair of functions for
    `resolveFunc` and `rejectFunc`; these are \"tethered\" to the
    `Promise` object.
2.  `executor` typically wraps some asynchronous operation which
    provides a callback-based API. The callback (the one passed to the
    original callback-based API) is defined within the `executor` code,
    so it has access to the `resolveFunc` and `rejectFunc`.
3.  The `executor` is called synchronously (as soon as the `Promise` is
    constructed) with the `resolveFunc` and `rejectFunc` functions as
    arguments.
4.  The code within the `executor` has the opportunity to perform some
    operation. The eventual completion of the asynchronous task is
    communicated with the promise instance via the side effect caused by
    `resolveFunc` or `rejectFunc`. The side effect is that the `Promise`
    object becomes \"resolved\".
    -   If `resolveFunc` is called first, the value passed will be
        [resolved](#the_resolve_function). The promise may stay pending
        (in case another [thenable](../promise#thenables) is passed),
        become fulfilled (in most cases where a non-thenable value is
        passed), or become rejected (in case of an invalid resolution
        value).
    -   If `rejectFunc` is called first, the promise instantly becomes
        rejected.
    -   Once one of the resolving functions (`resolveFunc` or
        `rejectFunc`) is called, the promise stays resolved. Only the
        first call to `resolveFunc` or `rejectFunc` affects the
        promise\'s eventual state, and subsequent calls to either
        function can neither change the fulfillment value/rejection
        reason nor toggle its eventual state from \"fulfilled\" to
        \"rejected\" or opposite.
    -   If `executor` exits by throwing an error, then the promise is
        rejected. However, the error is ignored if one of the resolving
        functions has already been called (so that the promise is
        already resolved).
    -   Resolving the promise does not necessarily cause the promise to
        become fulfilled or rejected (i.e. settled). The promise may
        still be pending because it\'s resolved with another thenable,
        but its eventual state will match that of the resolved thenable.
5.  Once the promise settles, it (asynchronously) invokes any further
    handlers associated through [`then()`](then), [`catch()`](catch), or
    [`finally()`](finally). The eventual fulfillment value or rejection
    reason is passed to the invocation of fulfillment and rejection
    handlers as an input parameter (see [Chained
    Promises](../promise#chained_promises)).

For example, the callback-based `readFile` API above can be transformed
into a promise-based one.

 
 
[js]


```js
const readFilePromise = (path) =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    readFile(path, (error, result) => {
      if (error) {
        reject(error);
      } else {
        resolve(result);
      }
    });
  });

readFilePromise("./data.txt")
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Failed to read data"));
```


The `resolve` and `reject` callbacks are only available within the scope
of the executor function, which means you can\'t access them after the
promise is constructed. If you want to construct the promise before
deciding how to resolve it, you can use the
[`Promise.withResolvers()`](withresolvers) method instead, which exposes
the `resolve` and `reject` functions.



 
### The resolve function 

 
The `resolve` function has the following behaviors:

-   If it\'s called with the same value as the newly created promise
    (the promise it\'s \"tethered to\"), the promise is rejected with a
    [`TypeError`](../typeerror).
-   If it\'s called with a non-[thenable](../promise#thenables) value (a
    primitive, or an object whose `then` property is not callable,
    including when the property is not present), the promise is
    immediately fulfilled with that value.
-   If it\'s called with a thenable value (including another `Promise`
    instance), then the thenable\'s `then` method is saved and called in
    the future (it\'s always called asynchronously). The `then` method
    will be called with two callbacks, which are two new functions with
    the exact same behaviors as the `resolveFunc` and `rejectFunc`
    passed to the `executor` function. If calling the `then` method
    throws, then the current promise is rejected with the thrown error.

In the last case, it means code like:

 
 
[js]


```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(thenable);
});
```


Is roughly equivalent to:

 
 
[js]


```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  try {
    thenable.then(
      (value) => resolve(value),
      (reason) => reject(reason),
    );
  } catch (e) {
    reject(e);
  }
});
```


Except that in the `resolve(thenable)` case:

1.  `resolve` is called synchronously, so that calling `resolve` or
    `reject` again has no effect, even when the handlers attached
    through `anotherPromise.then()` are not called yet.
2.  The `then` method is called asynchronously, so that the promise will
    never be instantly resolved if a thenable is passed.

Because `resolve` is called again with whatever `thenable.then()` passes
to it as `value`, the resolver function is able to flatten nested
thenables, where a thenable calls its `onFulfilled` handler with another
thenable. The effect is that the fulfillment handler of a real promise
will never receive a thenable as its fulfillment value.



 
Examples
--------


 
### Turning a callback-based API into a promise-based one 

 
To provide a function with promise functionality, have it return a
promise by calling the `resolve` and `reject` functions at the correct
times.

 
 
[js]


```js
function myAsyncFunction(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", url);
    xhr.onload = () => resolve(xhr.responseText);
    xhr.onerror = () => reject(xhr.statusText);
    xhr.send();
  });
}
```




 
### Effect of calling resolveFunc 

 
Calling `resolveFunc` causes the promise to become resolved, so that
calling `resolveFunc` or `rejectFunc` again has no effect. However, the
promise may be in any of the states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

This `pendingResolved` promise is resolved the time it\'s created,
because it has already been \"locked in\" to match the eventual state of
the inner promise, and calling `resolveOuter` or `rejectOuter` or
throwing an error later in the executor has no effect on its eventual
state. However, the inner promise is still pending until 100ms later, so
the outer promise is also pending:

 
 
[js]


```js
const pendingResolved = new Promise((resolveOuter, rejectOuter) => {
  resolveOuter(
    new Promise((resolveInner) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolveInner("inner");
      }, 100);
    }),
  );
});
```


This `fulfilledResolved` promise becomes fulfilled the moment it\'s
resolved, because it\'s resolved with a non-thenable value. However,
when it\'s created, it\'s unresolved, because neither `resolve` nor
`reject` has been called yet. An unresolved promise is necessarily
pending:

 
 
[js]


```js
const fulfilledResolved = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("outer");
  }, 100);
});
```


Calling `rejectFunc` obviously causes the promise to reject. However,
there are also two ways to cause the promise to instantly become
rejected even when the `resolveFunc` callback is called.

 
 
[js]


```js
// 1. Resolving with the promise itself
const rejectedResolved1 = new Promise((resolve) => {
  // Note: resolve has to be called asynchronously,
  // so that the rejectedResolved1 variable is initialized
  setTimeout(() => resolve(rejectedResolved1)); // TypeError: Chaining cycle detected for promise #<Promise>
});

// 2. Resolving with an object which throws when accessing the `then` property
const rejectedResolved2 = new Promise((resolve) => {
  resolve({
    get then() {
      throw new Error("Can't get then property");
    },
  });
});
```
