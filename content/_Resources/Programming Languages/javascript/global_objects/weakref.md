WeakRef
=======

 
A `WeakRef` object lets you hold a weak reference to another object,
without preventing that object from getting garbage-collected.


 
Description
-----------

 
A `WeakRef` object contains a weak reference to an object, which is
called its *target* or *referent*. A *weak reference* to an object is a
reference that does not prevent the object from being reclaimed by the
garbage collector. In contrast, a normal (or *strong*) reference keeps
an object in memory. When an object no longer has any strong references
to it, the JavaScript engine\'s garbage collector may destroy the object
and reclaim its memory. If that happens, you can\'t get the object from
a weak reference anymore.

Because [non-registered
symbols](symbol#shared_symbols_in_the_global_symbol_registry) are also
garbage collectable, they can also be used as the target of a `WeakRef`
object. However, the use case of this is limited.



 
### Avoid where possible 

 
Correct use of `WeakRef` takes careful thought, and it\'s best avoided
if possible. It\'s also important to avoid relying on any specific
behaviors not guaranteed by the specification. When, how, and whether
garbage collection occurs is down to the implementation of any given
JavaScript engine. Any behavior you observe in one engine may be
different in another engine, in another version of the same engine, or
even in a slightly different situation with the same version of the same
engine. Garbage collection is a hard problem that JavaScript engine
implementers are constantly refining and improving their solutions to.

Here are some specific points included by the authors in the
[proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs) that introduced
`WeakRef`:

>     incremental and concurrent techniques.
> -   Various runtime heuristics can be used to balance memory usage,
>     responsiveness.
> -   The JavaScript engine may hold references to things which look
>     like they are unreachable (e.g., in closures, or inline caches).
> -   Different JavaScript engines may do these things differently, or
>     the same engine may change its algorithms across versions.
> -   Complex factors may lead to objects being held alive for
>     unexpected amounts of time, such as use with certain APIs.



 
### Notes on WeakRefs 

 
-   If your code has just created a `WeakRef` for a target object, or
    has gotten a target object from a `WeakRef`\'s `deref` method, that
    target object will not be reclaimed until the end of the current
    JavaScript
    [job](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/executable-code-and-execution-contexts.html#job)
    (including any promise reaction jobs that run at the end of a script
    job). That is, you can only \"see\" an object get reclaimed between
    turns of the event loop. This is primarily to avoid making the
    behavior of any given JavaScript engine\'s garbage collector
    apparent in code --- because if it were, people would write code
    relying on that behavior, which would break when the garbage
    collector\'s behavior changed. (Garbage collection is a hard
    problem; JavaScript engine implementers are constantly refining and
    improving how it works.)
-   If multiple `WeakRef`s have the same target, they\'re consistent
    with one another. The result of calling `deref` on one of them will
    match the result of calling `deref` on another of them (in the same
    job), you won\'t get the target object from one of them but
    `undefined` from another.
-   If the target of a `WeakRef` is also in a
    [`FinalizationRegistry`](finalizationregistry), the `WeakRef`\'s
    target is cleared at the same time or before any cleanup callback
    associated with the registry is called; if your cleanup callback
    calls `deref` on a `WeakRef` for the object, it will receive
    `undefined`.
-   You cannot change the target of a `WeakRef`, it will always only
    ever be the original target object or `undefined` when that target
    has been reclaimed.
-   A `WeakRef` might never return `undefined` from `deref`, even if
    nothing strongly holds the target, because the garbage collector may
    never decide to reclaim the object.



 
Constructor
-----------

 

[`WeakRef()`](weakref/weakref)

:   Creates a new `WeakRef` object.



 
Instance properties 
-------------------

 
These properties are defined on `WeakRef.prototype` and shared by all
`WeakRef` instances.

[`WeakRef.prototype.constructor`](object/constructor) [Optional]

:   The constructor function that created the instance object. For
    `WeakRef` instances, the initial value is the
    [`WeakRef`](weakref/weakref) constructor.

     
    **Note:** This property is marked as \"normative optional\" in the
    specification, which means a conforming implementation may not
    expose the `constructor` property. This prevents arbitrary code from
    obtaining the `WeakRef` constructor and being able to observe
    garbage collection. However, all major engines do expose it by
    default.
    

[`WeakRef.prototype[@@toStringTag]`](#weakref.prototypetostringtag)

:   The initial value of the [`@@toStringTag`](symbol/tostringtag)
    property is the string `"WeakRef"`. This property is used in
    [`Object.prototype.toString()`](object/tostring).



 
Instance methods 
----------------

 

[`WeakRef.prototype.deref()`](weakref/deref)

:   Returns the `WeakRef` object\'s target object, or `undefined` if the
    target object has been reclaimed.



 
Examples

### Using a WeakRef object 

 
This example starts a counter shown in a DOM element, stopping when the
element doesn\'t exist anymore:

 
 
[js]


```js
class Counter {
  constructor(element) {
    // Remember a weak reference to the DOM element
    this.ref = new WeakRef(element);
    this.start();
  }

  start() {
    if (this.timer) {
      return;
    }

    this.count = 0;

    const tick = () => {
      // Get the element from the weak reference, if it still exists
      const element = this.ref.deref();
      if (element) {
        element.textContent = ++this.count;
      } else {
        // The element doesn't exist anymore
        console.log("The element is gone.");
        this.stop();
        this.ref = null;
      }
    };

    tick();
    this.timer = setInterval(tick, 1000);
  }

  stop() {
    if (this.timer) {
      clearInterval(this.timer);
      this.timer = 0;
    }
  }
}

const counter = new Counter(document.getElementById("counter"));
setTimeout(() => {
  document.getElementById("counter").remove();
}, 5000);
```
