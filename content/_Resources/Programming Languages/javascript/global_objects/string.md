String
======

 
The `String` object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of
characters.


 
Description
-----------

 
Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text
form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their
[`length`](string/length), to build and concatenate them using the [`+`
and `+=` string
operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#string_operators),
checking for the existence or location of substrings with the
[`indexOf()`](string/indexof) method, or extracting substrings with the
[`substring()`](string/substring) method.



 
### Creating strings 

 
Strings can be created as primitives, from string literals, or as
objects, using the [`String()`](string/string) constructor:

 
 
[js]


```js
const string1 = "A string primitive";
const string2 = 'Also a string primitive';
const string3 = `Yet another string primitive`;
```


 
 
[js]


```js
const string4 = new String("A String object");
```


String primitives and string objects share many behaviors, but have
other important differences and caveats. See \"[String primitives and
String objects](#string_primitives_and_string_objects)\" below.

String literals can be specified using single or double quotes, which
are treated identically, or using the backtick character [\`].
This last form specifies a [template literal](../template_literals):
with this form you can interpolate expressions. For more information on
the syntax of string literals, see [lexical
grammar](../lexical_grammar#string_literals).



 
### Character access 

 
There are two ways to access an individual character in a string. The
first is the [`charAt()`](string/charat) method:

 
 
[js]


```js
"cat".charAt(1); // gives value "a"
```


The other way is to treat the string as an array-like object, where
individual characters correspond to a numerical index:

 
 
[js]


```js
"cat"[1]; // gives value "a"
```


When using bracket notation for character access, attempting to delete
or assign a value to these properties will not succeed. The properties
involved are neither writable nor configurable. (See
[`Object.defineProperty()`](object/defineproperty) for more
information.)



 
### Comparing strings 

 
Use the [less-than and greater-than
operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators)
to compare strings:

 
 
[js]


```js
const a = "a";
const b = "b";
if (a < b) {
  // true
  console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);
} else if (a > b) {
  console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`);
} else {
  console.log(`${a} and ${b} are equal.`);
}
```


Note that all comparison operators, including
[`===`](../operators/strict_equality) and [`==`](../operators/equality),
compare strings case-sensitively. A common way to compare strings
case-insensitively is to convert both to the same case (upper or lower)
before comparing them.

 
 
[js]


```js
function areEqualCaseInsensitive(str1, str2) {
  return str1.toUpperCase() === str2.toUpperCase();
}
```


The choice of whether to transform by
[`toUpperCase()`](string/touppercase) or
[`toLowerCase()`](string/tolowercase) is mostly arbitrary, and neither
one is fully robust when extending beyond the Latin alphabet. For
example, the German lowercase letter `ß` and `ss` are both transformed
to `SS` by `toUpperCase()`, while the Turkish letter `ı` would be
falsely reported as unequal to `I` by `toLowerCase()` unless
specifically using
[`toLocaleLowerCase("tr")`](string/tolocalelowercase).

 
 
[js]


```js
const areEqualInUpperCase = (str1, str2) =>
  str1.toUpperCase() === str2.toUpperCase();
const areEqualInLowerCase = (str1, str2) =>
  str1.toLowerCase() === str2.toLowerCase();

areEqualInUpperCase("ß", "ss"); // true; should be false
areEqualInLowerCase("ı", "I"); // false; should be true
```


A locale-aware and robust solution for testing case-insensitive equality
is to use the [`Intl.Collator`](intl/collator) API or the string\'s
[`localeCompare()`](string/localecompare) method --- they share the same
interface --- with the
[`sensitivity`](intl/collator/collator#sensitivity) option set to
`"accent"` or `"base"`.

 
 
[js]


```js
const areEqual = (str1, str2, locale = "en-US") =>
  str1.localeCompare(str2, locale, { sensitivity: "accent" }) === 0;

areEqual("ß", "ss", "de"); // false
areEqual("ı", "I", "tr"); // true
```


The `localeCompare()` method enables string comparison in a similar
fashion as `strcmp()` --- it allows sorting strings in a locale-aware
manner.



 
### String primitives and String objects 

 
Note that JavaScript distinguishes between `String` objects and
[primitive
string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive)
values. (The same is true of [`Boolean`](boolean) and
[`Numbers`](number).)

String literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings
returned from `String` calls in a non-constructor context (that is,
called without using the [`new`](../operators/new) keyword) are
primitive strings. In contexts where a method is to be invoked on a
primitive string or a property lookup occurs, JavaScript will
automatically wrap the string primitive and call the method or perform
the property lookup on the wrapper object instead.

 
 
[js]


```js
const strPrim = "foo"; // A literal is a string primitive
const strPrim2 = String(1); // Coerced into the string primitive "1"
const strPrim3 = String(true); // Coerced into the string primitive "true"
const strObj = new String(strPrim); // String with new returns a string wrapper object.

console.log(typeof strPrim); // "string"
console.log(typeof strPrim2); // "string"
console.log(typeof strPrim3); // "string"
console.log(typeof strObj); // "object"
```


 
**Warning:** You should rarely find yourself using `String` as a
constructor.


String primitives and `String` objects also give different results when
using [`eval()`](eval). Primitives passed to `eval` are treated as
source code; `String` objects are treated as all other objects are, by
returning the object. For example:

 
 
[js]


```js
const s1 = "2 + 2"; // creates a string primitive
const s2 = new String("2 + 2"); // creates a String object
console.log(eval(s1)); // returns the number 4
console.log(eval(s2)); // returns the string "2 + 2"
```


For these reasons, the code may break when it encounters `String`
objects when it expects a primitive string instead, although generally,
authors need not worry about the distinction.

A `String` object can always be converted to its primitive counterpart
with the [`valueOf()`](string/valueof) method.

 
 
[js]


```js
console.log(eval(s2.valueOf())); // returns the number 4
```




 
### String coercion 

 
Many built-in operations that expect strings first coerce their
arguments to strings (which is largely why `String` objects behave
similarly to string primitives). [The
operation](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-tostring)
can be summarized as follows:

-   Strings are returned as-is.
-   [`undefined`](undefined) turns into `"undefined"`.
-   [`null`](../operators/null) turns into `"null"`.
-   `true` turns into `"true"`; `false` turns into `"false"`.
-   Numbers are converted with the same algorithm as
    [`toString(10)`](number/tostring).
-   [BigInts](bigint) are converted with the same algorithm as
    [`toString(10)`](bigint/tostring).
-   [Symbols](symbol) throw a [`TypeError`](typeerror).
-   Objects are first [converted to a
    primitive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#primitive_coercion)
    by calling its [`[@@toPrimitive]()`](symbol/toprimitive) (with
    `"string"` as hint), `toString()`, and `valueOf()` methods, in that
    order. The resulting primitive is then converted to a string.

There are several ways to achieve nearly the same effect in JavaScript.

-   [Template literal](../template_literals): `` `${x}` `` does exactly
    the string coercion steps explained above for the embedded
    expression.
-   The [`String()`](string/string) function: `String(x)` uses the same
    algorithm to convert `x`, except that [Symbols](symbol) don\'t throw
    a [`TypeError`](typeerror), but return `"Symbol(description)"`,
    where `description` is the [description](symbol/description) of the
    Symbol.
-   Using the [`+` operator](../operators/addition): `"" + x` coerces
    its operand to a *primitive* instead of a *string*, and, for some
    objects, has entirely different behaviors from normal string
    coercion. See its [reference page](../operators/addition) for more
    details.

Depending on your use case, you may want to use `` `${x}` `` (to mimic
built-in behavior) or `String(x)` (to handle symbol values without
throwing an error), but you should not use `"" + x`.



 
### UTF-16 characters, Unicode code points, and grapheme clusters 

 
Strings are represented fundamentally as sequences of [UTF-16 code
units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16). In UTF-16 encoding, every
code unit is exact 16 bits long. This means there are a maximum of
2^16^, or 65536 possible characters representable as single UTF-16 code
units. This character set is called the [basic multilingual plane
(BMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane),
and includes the most common characters like the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic
alphabets, as well as many East Asian characters. Each code unit can be
written in a string with `\u` followed by exactly four hex digits.

However, the entire Unicode character set is much, much bigger than
65536. The extra characters are stored in UTF-16 as *surrogate pairs*,
which are pairs of 16-bit code units that represent a single character.
To avoid ambiguity, the two parts of the pair must be between `0xD800`
and `0xDFFF`, and these code units are not used to encode
single-code-unit characters. (More precisely, leading surrogates, also
called high-surrogate code units, have values between `0xD800` and
`0xDBFF`, inclusive, while trailing surrogates, also called
low-surrogate code units, have values between `0xDC00` and `0xDFFF`,
inclusive.) Each Unicode character, comprised of one or two UTF-16 code
units, is also called a *Unicode code point*. Each Unicode code point
can be written in a string with `\u{xxxxxx}` where `xxxxxx` represents
1--6 hex digits.

A \"lone surrogate\" is a 16-bit code unit satisfying one of the
descriptions below:

-   It is in the range `0xD800`--`0xDBFF`, inclusive (i.e. is a leading
    surrogate), but it is the last code unit in the string, or the next
    code unit is not a trailing surrogate.
-   It is in the range `0xDC00`--`0xDFFF`, inclusive (i.e. is a trailing
    surrogate), but it is the first code unit in the string, or the
    previous code unit is not a leading surrogate.

Lone surrogates do not represent any Unicode character. Although most
JavaScript built-in methods handle them correctly because they all work
based on UTF-16 code units, lone surrogates are often not valid values
when interacting with other systems --- for example,
[`encodeURI()`](encodeuri) will throw a [`URIError`](urierror) for lone
surrogates, because URI encoding uses UTF-8 encoding, which does not
have any encoding for lone surrogates. Strings not containing any lone
surrogates are called *well-formed* strings, and are safe to be used
with functions that do not deal with UTF-16 (such as `encodeURI()` or
[`TextEncoder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder)).
You can check if a string is well-formed with the
[`isWellFormed()`](string/iswellformed) method, or sanitize lone
surrogates with the [`toWellFormed()`](string/towellformed) method.

On top of Unicode characters, there are certain sequences of Unicode
characters that should be treated as one visual unit, known as a
*grapheme cluster*. The most common case is emojis: many emojis that
have a range of variations are actually formed by multiple emojis,
usually joined by the \<ZWJ\> (`U+200D`) character.

You must be careful which level of characters you are iterating on. For
example, [`split("")`](string/split) will split by UTF-16 code units and
will separate surrogate pairs. String indexes also refer to the index of
each UTF-16 code unit. On the other hand,
[`@@iterator()`](string/@@iterator) iterates by Unicode code points.
Iterating through grapheme clusters will require some custom code.

 
 
[js]


```js
"😄".split(""); // ['\ud83d', '\ude04']; splits into two lone surrogates

// "Backhand Index Pointing Right: Dark Skin Tone"
[..."👉🏿"]; // ['👉', '🏿']
// splits into the basic "Backhand Index Pointing Right" emoji and
// the "Dark skin tone" emoji

// "Family: Man, Boy"
[..."👨‍👦"]; // [ '👨', '‍', '👦' ]
// splits into the "Man" and "Boy" emoji, joined by a ZWJ

// The United Nations flag
[..."🇺🇳"]; // [ '🇺', '🇳' ]
// splits into two "region indicator" letters "U" and "N".
// All flag emojis are formed by joining two region indicator letters
```




 
Constructor
-----------

 

[`String()`](string/string)

:   Creates a new `String` object. It performs type conversion when
    called as a function, rather than as a constructor, which is usually
    more useful.



 
Static methods 
--------------

 

[`String.fromCharCode()`](string/fromcharcode)

:   Returns a string created by using the specified sequence of Unicode
    values.

    a String value, returning each code point as a String value.



 
### HTML wrapper methods 

 
 
**Warning:** Deprecated. Avoid these methods.

They are of limited use, as they are based on a very old HTML standard
and provide only a subset of the currently available HTML tags and
attributes. Many of them create deprecated or non-standard markup today.
In addition, they do simple string concatenation without any validation
or sanitation, which makes them a potential security threat when
directly inserted using
[`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML).
Use [DOM
APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
such as
[`document.createElement()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)
instead.


[`String.prototype.anchor()`](string/anchor) [Deprecated]

:   [`<a name="name">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#name)
    (hypertext target)

[`String.prototype.big()`](string/big) [Deprecated]
:   [`<big>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/big)

[`String.prototype.blink()`](string/blink) [Deprecated]

:   `<blink>`

[`String.prototype.bold()`](string/bold) [Deprecated]
:   [`<b>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b)

[`String.prototype.fixed()`](string/fixed) [Deprecated]
:   [`<tt>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tt)

[`String.prototype.fontcolor()`](string/fontcolor) [Deprecated]

:   [`<font color="color">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/font#color)

[`String.prototype.fontsize()`](string/fontsize) [Deprecated]

:   [`<font size="size">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/font#size)

[`String.prototype.italics()`](string/italics) [Deprecated]
:   [`<i>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i)

[`String.prototype.link()`](string/link) [Deprecated]

:   [`<a href="url">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#href)
    (link to URL)

[`String.prototype.small()`](string/small) [Deprecated]
:   [`<small>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small)

[`String.prototype.strike()`](string/strike) [Deprecated]
:   [`<strike>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strike)

[`String.prototype.sub()`](string/sub) [Deprecated]
:   [`<sub>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sub)

[`String.prototype.sup()`](string/sup) [Deprecated]
:   [`<sup>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sup)

Note that these methods do not check if the string itself contains HTML
tags, so it\'s possible to create invalid HTML:

 
 
[js]


```js
"</b>".bold(); // <b></b></b>
```


The only escaping they do is to replace `"` in the attribute value (for
[`anchor()`](string/anchor), [`fontcolor()`](string/fontcolor),
[`fontsize()`](string/fontsize), and [`link()`](string/link)) with
`&quot;`.

 
 
[js]


```js
"foo".anchor('"Hello"'); // <a name="&quot;Hello&quot;">foo</a>
```




 
Examples

### String conversion 

 
The `String()` function is a more reliable way of converting values to
strings than calling the `toString()` method of the value, as the former
works when used on [`null`](../operators/null) and
[`undefined`](undefined). For example:

 
 
[js]


```js
// You cannot access properties on null or undefined

const nullVar = null;
nullVar.toString(); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of null
String(nullVar); // "null"

const undefinedVar = undefined;
undefinedVar.toString(); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
String(undefinedVar); // "undefined"
```
