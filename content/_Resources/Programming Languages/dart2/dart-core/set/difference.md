=================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Set](../set-class)\<E\> difference(

1.  [Set](../set-class)\<[Object](../object-class)?\> other

)
:::

Creates a new set with the elements of this that are not in `other`.

That is, the returned set contains all the elements of this
[Set](../set-class) that are not elements of `other` according to
`other.contains`.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final characters1 = <String>{'A', 'B', 'C'};
final characters2 = <String>{'A', 'E', 'F'};
final differenceSet1 = characters1.difference(characters2);
print(differenceSet1); // {B, C}
final differenceSet2 = characters2.difference(characters1);
print(differenceSet2); // {E, F}
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Set<E> difference(Set<Object?> other);
```
