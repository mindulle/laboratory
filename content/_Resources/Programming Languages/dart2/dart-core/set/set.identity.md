Set\<E\>.identity constructor
=============================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
Set\<E\>.identity()
:::

Creates an empty identity [Set](../set-class).

The created [Set](../set-class) is a
[LinkedHashSet](../../dart-collection/linkedhashset-class) that uses
identity as equality relation.

The set is equivalent to one created by `LinkedHashSet<E>.identity()`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
factory Set.identity() = LinkedHashSet<E>.identity;
```
