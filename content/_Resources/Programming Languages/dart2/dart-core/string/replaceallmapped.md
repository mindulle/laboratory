replaceAllMapped method
=======================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[String](../string-class) replaceAllMapped(

1.  [Pattern](../pattern-class) from,
2.  [String](../string-class) replace(
    1.  [Match](../match-class) match

    )

)
:::

Replace all substrings that match `from` by a computed string.

Creates a new string in which the non-overlapping substrings that match
`from` (the ones iterated by `from.allMatches(thisString)`) are replaced
by the result of calling `replace` on the corresponding
[Match](../match-class) object.

This can be used to replace matches with new content that depends on the
match, unlike [replaceAll](replaceall) where the replacement string is
always the same.

The `replace` function is called with the [Match](../match-class)
generated by the pattern, and its result is used as replacement.

The function defined below converts each word in a string to simplified
\'pig latin\' using [replaceAllMapped](replaceallmapped):

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
String pigLatin(String words) => words.replaceAllMapped(
    RegExp(r'\b(\w*?)([aeiou]\w*)', caseSensitive: false),
    (Match m) => "${m[2]}${m[1]}${m[1]!.isEmpty ? 'way' : 'ay'}");

final result = pigLatin('I have a secret now!');
print(result); // 'Iway avehay away ecretsay ownay!'
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
String replaceAllMapped(Pattern from, String Function(Match match) replace);
```
