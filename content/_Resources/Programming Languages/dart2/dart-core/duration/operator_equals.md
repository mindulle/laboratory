Whether this [Duration](../duration-class) has the same length as
`other`.

Durations have the same length if they have the same number of
microseconds, as reported by [inMicroseconds](inmicroseconds).

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool operator ==(Object other) =>
    other is Duration && _duration == other.inMicroseconds;
```
