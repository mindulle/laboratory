operator unary- method
======================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Duration](../duration-class) operator unary-()
:::

Creates a new [Duration](../duration-class) with the opposite direction
of this [Duration](../duration-class).

The returned [Duration](../duration-class) has the same length as this
one, but will have the opposite sign (as reported by
[isNegative](isnegative)) as this one where possible.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
// Using subtraction helps dart2js avoid negative zeros.
Duration operator -() => Duration._microseconds(0 - _duration);
```
