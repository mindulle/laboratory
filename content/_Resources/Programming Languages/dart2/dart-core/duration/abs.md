abs method
==========

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Duration](../duration-class) abs()

Creates a new [Duration](../duration-class) representing the absolute
length of this [Duration](../duration-class).

The returned [Duration](../duration-class) has the same length as this
one, but is always positive where possible.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Duration abs() => Duration._microseconds(_duration.abs());
```
