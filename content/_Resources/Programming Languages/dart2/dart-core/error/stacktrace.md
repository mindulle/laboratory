stackTrace property
===================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[StackTrace](../stacktrace-class)? stackTrace
:::

The stack trace at the point where this error was first thrown.

Classes which *extend* `Error` will automatically have a stack trace
filled in the first time they are thrown by a `throw` expression.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external StackTrace? get stackTrace;
```
