DateTime.utc constructor
========================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
DateTime.utc(

1.  [int](../int-class) year,
2.  \[[int](../int-class) month = 1,
3.  [int](../int-class) day = 1,
4.  [int](../int-class) hour = 0,
5.  [int](../int-class) minute = 0,
6.  [int](../int-class) second = 0,
7.  [int](../int-class) millisecond = 0,
8.  [int](../int-class) microsecond = 0\]

)
:::

Constructs a [DateTime](../datetime-class) instance specified in the UTC
time zone.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final moonLanding = DateTime.utc(1969, 7, 20, 20, 18, 04);
```

When dealing with dates or historic events, preferably use UTC
DateTimes, since they are unaffected by daylight-saving changes and are
unaffected by the local timezone.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
DateTime.utc(int year,
    [int month = 1,
    int day = 1,
    int hour = 0,
    int minute = 0,
    int second = 0,
    int millisecond = 0,
    int microsecond = 0])
    : this._internal(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond,
          microsecond, true);
```
