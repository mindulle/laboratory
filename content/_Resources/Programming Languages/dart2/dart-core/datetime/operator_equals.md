Returns true if `other` is a [DateTime](../datetime-class) at the same
moment and in the same time zone (UTC or local).

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final dDayUtc = DateTime.utc(1944, 6, 6);
final dDayLocal = dDayUtc.toLocal();

// These two dates are at the same moment, but are in different zones.
assert(dDayUtc != dDayLocal);
print(dDayUtc != dDayLocal); // true
```

See [isAtSameMomentAs](isatsamemomentas) for a comparison that compares
moments in time independently of their zones.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external bool operator ==(Object other);
```
