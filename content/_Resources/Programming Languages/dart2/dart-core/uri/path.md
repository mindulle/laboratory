path property
=============

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[String](../string-class) path
:::

The path component.

The path is the actual substring of the URI representing the path, and
it is encoded where necessary. To get direct access to the decoded path,
use [pathSegments](pathsegments).

The path value is the empty string if there is no path component.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
String get path;
```
