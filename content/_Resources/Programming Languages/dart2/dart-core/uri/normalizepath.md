normalizePath method
====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Uri](../uri-class) normalizePath()
:::

Returns a URI where the path has been normalized.

A normalized path does not contain `.` segments or non-leading `..`
segments. Only a relative path with no scheme or authority may contain
leading `..` segments; a path that starts with `/` will also drop any
leading `..` segments.

This uses the same normalization strategy as `Uri().resolve(this)`.

Does not change any part of the URI except the path.

The default implementation of `Uri` always normalizes paths, so calling
this function has no effect.

--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Uri normalizePath();
```
