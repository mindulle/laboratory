queryParametersAll property
===========================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[Map](../map-class)\<[String](../string-class),
[List](../list-class)\<[String](../string-class)\>\> queryParametersAll
:::

Returns the URI query split into a map according to the rules specified
for FORM post in the [HTML 4.01 specification section
17.13.4](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4 "HTML 4.01 section 17.13.4").

Each key and value in the resulting map has been decoded. If there is no
query, the map is empty.

Keys are mapped to lists of their values. If a key occurs only once, its
value is a singleton list. If a key occurs with no value, the empty
string is used as the value for that occurrence.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final uri =
    Uri.parse('https://example.com/api/fetch?limit=10,20,30&max=100');
print(jsonEncode(uri.queryParameters)); // {"limit":"10,20,30","max":"100"}
```

The map and the lists it contains are unmodifiable.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Map<String, List<String>> get queryParametersAll;
```
