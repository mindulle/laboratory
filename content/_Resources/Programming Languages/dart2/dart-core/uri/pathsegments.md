pathSegments property
=====================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[List](../list-class)\<[String](../string-class)\> pathSegments
:::

The URI path split into its segments.

Each of the segments in the list has been decoded. If the path is empty,
the empty list will be returned. A leading slash `/` does not affect the
segments returned.

The list is unmodifiable and will throw
[UnsupportedError](../unsupportederror-class) on any calls that would
mutate it.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
List<String> get pathSegments;
```
