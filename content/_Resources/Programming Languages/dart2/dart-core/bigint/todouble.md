toDouble method
===============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[double](../double-class) toDouble()
:::

Returns this [BigInt](../bigint-class) as a [double](../double-class).

If the number is not representable as a [double](../double-class), an
approximation is returned. For numerically large integers, the
approximation may be infinite.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
var bigNumber = BigInt.parse('100000000000000000000000');
print(bigNumber.toDouble()); // 1e+23
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
double toDouble();
```
