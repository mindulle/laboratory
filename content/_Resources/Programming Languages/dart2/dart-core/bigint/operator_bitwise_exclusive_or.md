operator \^ method
==================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[BigInt](../bigint-class) operator \^(

1.  [BigInt](../bigint-class) other

)
:::

Bit-wise exclusive-or operator.

Treating both `this` and `other` as sufficiently large two\'s component
integers, the result is a number with the bits set that are set in one,
but not both, of `this` and `other`

If the operands have the same sign, the result is non-negative,
otherwise the result is negative.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
BigInt operator ^(BigInt other);
```
