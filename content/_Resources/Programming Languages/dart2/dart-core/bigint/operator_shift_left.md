operator \<\< method
====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[BigInt](../bigint-class) operator \<\<(

1.  [int](../int-class) shiftAmount

)
:::

Shift the bits of this integer to the left by `shiftAmount`.

Shifting to the left makes the number larger, effectively multiplying
the number by `pow(2, shiftIndex)`.

There is no limit on the size of the result. It may be relevant to limit
intermediate values by using the \"and\" operator with a suitable mask.

It is an error if `shiftAmount` is negative.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
BigInt operator <<(int shiftAmount);
```
