round method
============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[int](../int-class) round()
:::

The integer closest to this number.

Rounds away from zero when there is no closest integer:
`(3.5).round() == 4` and `(-3.5).round() == -4`.

The number must be finite (see [isFinite](isfinite)).

If the value is greater than the highest representable positive integer,
the result is that highest positive integer. If the value is smaller
than the highest representable negative integer, the result is that
highest negative integer.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
int round();
```
