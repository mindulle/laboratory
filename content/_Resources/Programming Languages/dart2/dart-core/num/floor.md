floor method
============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[int](../int-class) floor()
:::

The greatest integer no greater than this number.

Rounds fractional values towards negative infinity.

The number must be finite (see [isFinite](isfinite)).

If the value is greater than the highest representable positive integer,
the result is that highest positive integer. If the value is smaller
than the highest representable negative integer, the result is that
highest negative integer.

```
