isNegative property
===================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[bool](../bool-class) isNegative
:::

Whether this number is negative.

A number is negative if it\'s smaller than zero, or if it is the double
`-0.0`. This precludes a NaN value like
[double.nan](../double/nan-constant) from being negative.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool get isNegative;
```
