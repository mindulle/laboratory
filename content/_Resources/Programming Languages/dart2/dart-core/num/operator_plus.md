operator + method
=================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[num](../num-class) operator +(

1.  [num](../num-class) other

)
:::

Adds `other` to this number.

The result is an [int](../int-class), as described by
[int.+](operator_plus), if both this number and `other` is an integer,
otherwise the result is a [double](../double-class).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
num operator +(num other);
```
