truncateToDouble method
=======================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[double](../double-class) truncateToDouble()
:::

Returns the double integer value obtained by discarding any fractional
digits from the double value of `this`.

If this is already an integer valued double, including `-0.0`, or it is
a non-finite double value, the value is returned unmodified.

For the purpose of rounding, `-0.0` is considered to be below `0.0`. A
number `d` in the range `-1.0 < d < 0.0` will return `-0.0`, and in the
range `0.0 < d < 1.0` it will return 0.0.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
double truncateToDouble();
```
