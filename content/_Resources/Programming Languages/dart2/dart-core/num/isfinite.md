isFinite property
=================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[bool](../bool-class) isFinite
:::

Whether this number is finite.

The only non-finite numbers are NaN values, positive infinity, and
negative infinity. All integers are finite.

All numbers satisfy exactly one of [isInfinite](isinfinite), `isFinite`
and [isNaN](isnan).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool get isFinite;
```
