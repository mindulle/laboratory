ceil method
===========

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[int](../int-class) ceil()
:::

The least integer no smaller than `this`.

Rounds fractional values towards positive infinity.

The number must be finite (see [isFinite](isfinite)).

If the value is greater than the highest representable positive integer,
the result is that highest positive integer. If the value is smaller
than the highest representable negative integer, the result is that
highest negative integer.

```
