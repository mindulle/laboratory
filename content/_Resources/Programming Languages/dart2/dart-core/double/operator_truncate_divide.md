Truncating division operator.

Performs truncating division of this number by `other`. Truncating
division is division where a fractional result is converted to an
integer by rounding towards zero.

If both operands are [int](../int-class)s, then `other` must not be
zero. Then `a ~/ b` corresponds to `a.remainder(b)` such that
`a == (a ~/ b) * b + a.remainder(b)`.

If either operand is a [double](../double-class), then the other operand
is converted to a double before performing the division and truncation
of the result. Then `a ~/ b` is equivalent to `(a / b).truncate()`. This
means that the intermediate result of the double division must be a
finite integer (not an infinity or [double.nan](nan-constant)).
