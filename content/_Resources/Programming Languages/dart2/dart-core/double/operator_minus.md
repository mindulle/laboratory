Subtracts `other` from this number.

The result is an [int](../int-class), as described by
[int.-](../num/operator_minus), if both this number and `other` is an
integer, otherwise the result is a [double](../double-class).

--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
double operator -(num other);
```
