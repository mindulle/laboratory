values property
===============

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[Iterable](../iterable-class)\<V\> values
:::

The values of [this](../map-class).

The values are iterated in the order of their corresponding keys. This
means that iterating [keys](keys) and [values](values) in parallel will
provide matching pairs of keys and values.

The returned iterable has an efficient `length` method based on the
[length](length) of the map. Its
[Iterable.contains](../iterable/contains) method is based on `==`
comparison.

Modifying the map while iterating the values may break the iteration.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Iterable<V> get values;
```
