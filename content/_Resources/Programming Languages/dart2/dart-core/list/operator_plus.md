operator + method
=================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[List](../list-class)\<E\> operator +(

1.  [List](../list-class)\<E\> other

)
:::

Returns the concatenation of this list and `other`.

Returns a new list containing the elements of this list followed by the
elements of `other`.

The default behavior is to return a normal growable list. Some list
types may choose to return a list of the same type as themselves (see
[Uint8List.+](../../dart-typed_data/uint8list/operator_plus));

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
List<E> operator +(List<E> other);
```
