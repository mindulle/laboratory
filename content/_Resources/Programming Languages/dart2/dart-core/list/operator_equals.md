:::

Whether this list is equal to `other`.

Lists are, by default, only equal to themselves. Even if `other` is also
a list, the equality comparison does not compare the elements of the two
lists.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool operator ==(Object other);
```
