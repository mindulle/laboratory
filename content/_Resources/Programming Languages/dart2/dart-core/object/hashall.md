Creates a combined hash code for a sequence of objects.

The hash code is computed for elements in `objects`, even if they are
`null`, by numerically combining the [Object.hashCode](hashcode) of each
element in iteration order.

The result of `hashAll([o])` is not `o.hashCode`.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
class SomeObject {
  final List<String> path;
  SomeObject(this.path);
  bool operator ==(Object other) {
    if (other is SomeObject) {
      if (path.length != other.path.length) return false;
      for (int i = 0; i < path.length; i++) {
        if (path[i] != other.path[i]) return false;
      }
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  int get hashCode => Object.hashAll(path);
}
```

The computed value will be consistent when the function is called again
with objects that have the same hash codes in the same order during an
execution of a single program.

The hash value generated by this function is *not* guaranteed to be
stable over different runs of the same program, or between code run in
different isolates of the same program. The exact algorithm used may
differ between different platforms, or between different versions of the
platform libraries, and it may depend on values that change on each
program execution.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
@Since("2.14")
static int hashAll(Iterable<Object?> objects) {
  int hash = _hashSeed;
  for (var object in objects) {
    hash = SystemHash.combine(hash, object.hashCode);
  }
  return SystemHash.finish(hash);
}
```
