Object constructor
==================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
const Object()
:::

Creates a new [Object](../object-class) instance.

[Object](../object-class) instances have no meaningful state, and are
only useful through their identity. An [Object](../object-class)
instance is equal to itself only.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
@pragma("vm:recognized", "other")
const Object();
```
