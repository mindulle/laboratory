Creates a combined hash code for a collection of objects.

The hash code is computed for elements in `objects`, even if they are
`null`, by numerically combining the [Object.hashCode](hashcode) of each
element in an order independent way.

The result of `unorderedHashAll({o})` is not `o.hashCode`.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool setEquals<T>(Set<T> set1, Set<T> set2) {
  var hashCode1 = Object.unorderedHashAll(set1);
  var hashCode2 = Object.unorderedHashAll(set2);
  if (hashCode1 != hashCode2) return false;
  // Compare elements ...
}
```

The computed value will be consistent when the function is called again
with objects that have the same hash codes during an execution of a
single program, even if the objects are not necessarily in the same
order,

The hash value generated by this function is *not* guaranteed to be
stable over different runs of the same program. The exact algorithm used
may differ between different platforms, or between different versions of
the platform libraries, and it may depend on values that change per
program run

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
@Since("2.14")
static int hashAllUnordered(Iterable<Object?> objects) {
  int sum = 0;
  int count = 0;
  const int mask = 0x3FFFFFFF;
  for (var object in objects) {
    int objectHash = SystemHash.smear(object.hashCode);
    sum = (sum + objectHash) & mask;
    count += 1;
  }
  return SystemHash.hash2(sum, count);
}
```
