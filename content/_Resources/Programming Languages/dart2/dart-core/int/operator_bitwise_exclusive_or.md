operator \^ method
==================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[int](../int-class) operator \^(

1.  [int](../int-class) other

)
:::

Bit-wise exclusive-or operator.

Treating both `this` and `other` as sufficiently large two\'s component
integers, the result is a number with the bits set that are set in one,
but not both, of `this` and `other`

If the operands have the same sign, the result is non-negative,
otherwise the result is negative.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
print((2 ^ 1).toRadixString(2)); //  0010 ^ 0001 -> 0011
print((3 ^ 1).toRadixString(2)); //  0011 ^ 0001 -> 0010
print((10 ^ 2).toRadixString(2)); //  1010 ^ 0010 -> 1000
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
int operator ^(int other);
```
