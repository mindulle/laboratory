closeSync method
================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void closeSync()
:::

Closes the [RawSynchronousSocket](../rawsynchronoussocket-class).

Once [closeSync](closesync) has been called, attempting to call
[readSync](readsync), [readIntoSync](readintosync),
[writeFromSync](writefromsync), [remoteAddress](remoteaddress), and
[remotePort](remoteport) will cause a
[SocketException](../socketexception-class) to be thrown.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void closeSync();
```
