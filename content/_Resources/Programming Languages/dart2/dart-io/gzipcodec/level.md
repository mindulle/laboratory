The compression-[level](level) can be set in the range of `-1..9`, with
`6` being the default compression level. Levels above `6` will have
higher compression rates at the cost of more CPU and memory usage.
Levels below `6` will use less CPU and memory at the cost of lower
compression rates.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final int level;
```
