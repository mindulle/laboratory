:::

Adds all elements of the given `stream`.

Returns a [Future](../../dart-async/future-class) that completes when
all elements of the given `stream` have been added.

If the stream contains an error, the `addStream` ends at the error, and
the returned future completes with that error.

This function must not be called when a stream is currently being added
using this function.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Future addStream(Stream<List<int>> stream);
```
