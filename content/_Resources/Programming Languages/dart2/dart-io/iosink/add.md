:::

Adds byte `data` to the target consumer, ignoring [encoding](encoding).

The [encoding](encoding) does not apply to this method, and the `data`
list is passed directly to the target consumer as a stream event.

This function must not be called when a stream is currently being added
using [addStream](addstream).

This operation is non-blocking. See [flush](flush) or [done](done) for
how to get any errors generated by this call.

The data list should not be modified after it has been passed to `add`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void add(List<int> data);
```
