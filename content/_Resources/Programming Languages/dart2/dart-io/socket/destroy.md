destroy method
==============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void destroy()
:::

Destroys the socket in both directions.

Calling [destroy](destroy) will make the send a close event on the
stream and will no longer react on data being piped to it.

Call [close](close) (inherited from [IOSink](../iosink-class)) to only
close the [Socket](../socket-class) for sending data.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void destroy();
```
