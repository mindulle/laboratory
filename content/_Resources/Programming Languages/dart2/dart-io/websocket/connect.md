1.  [String](../../dart-core/string-class) url,
2.  {[Iterable](../../dart-core/iterable-class)\<[String](../../dart-core/string-class)\>?

)
:::

Create a new WebSocket connection. The URL supplied in `url` must use
the scheme `ws` or `wss`.

The `protocols` argument is specifying the subprotocols the client is
willing to speak.

The `headers` argument is specifying additional HTTP headers for setting
up the connection. This would typically be the `Origin` header and
potentially cookies. The keys of the map are the header fields and the
values are either String or List.

If `headers` is provided, there are a number of headers which are
controlled by the WebSocket connection process. These headers are:

-   `connection`
-   `sec-websocket-key`
-   `sec-websocket-protocol`
-   `sec-websocket-version`
-   `upgrade`

If any of these are passed in the `headers` map they will be ignored.

If the `url` contains user information this will be passed as basic
authentication when setting up the connection.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static Future<WebSocket> connect(String url,
        {Iterable<String>? protocols,
        Map<String, dynamic>? headers,
        CompressionOptions compression =
            CompressionOptions.compressionDefault,
        HttpClient? customClient}) =>
    _WebSocketImpl.connect(url, protocols, headers,
        compression: compression, customClient: customClient);
```
