extensions property
===================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[String](../../dart-core/string-class) extensions
:::

The extensions property is initially the empty string. After the
WebSocket connection is established this string reflects the extensions
used by the server.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
String get extensions;
```
