peerCertificate property
========================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[X509Certificate](../x509certificate-class)? peerCertificate
:::

Get the peer certificate for a connected RawSecureSocket. If this
RawSecureSocket is the server end of a secure socket connection,
[peerCertificate](peercertificate) will return the client certificate,
or null, if no client certificate was received. If it is the client end,
[peerCertificate](peercertificate) will return the server\'s
certificate.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
X509Certificate? get peerCertificate;
```
