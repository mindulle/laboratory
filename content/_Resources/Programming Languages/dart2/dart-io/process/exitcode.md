exitCode property

[Future](../../dart-async/future-class)\<[int](../../dart-core/int-class)\>
exitCode
:::

A `Future` which completes with the exit code of the process when the
process completes.

The handling of exit codes is platform specific.

On Linux and OS X a normal exit code will be a positive value in the
range `[0..255]`. If the process was terminated due to a signal the exit
code will be a negative value in the range `[-255..-1]`, where the
absolute value of the exit code is the signal number. For example, if a
process crashes due to a segmentation violation the exit code will be
-11, as the signal SIGSEGV has the number 11.

On Windows a process can report any 32-bit value as an exit code. When
returning the exit code this exit code is turned into a signed value.
Some special values are used to report termination due to some system
event. E.g. if a process crashes due to an access violation the 32-bit
exit code is `0xc0000005`, which will be returned as the negative number
`-1073741819`. To get the original 32-bit value use
`(0x100000000 + exitCode) & 0xffffffff`.

There is no guarantee that [stdout](stdout) and [stderr](stderr) have
finished reporting the buffered output of the process when the returned
future completes. To be sure that all output is captured, wait for the
done event on the streams.
