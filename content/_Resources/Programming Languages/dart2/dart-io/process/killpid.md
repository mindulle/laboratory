killPid method
==============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) killPid(

1.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) pid,
2.  \[[ProcessSignal](../processsignal-class) signal =
    ProcessSignal.sigterm\]

)
:::

Kills the process with id `pid`.

Where possible, sends the `signal` to the process with id `pid`. This
includes Linux and OS X. The default signal is
[ProcessSignal.sigterm](../processsignal/sigterm-constant) which will
normally terminate the process.

On platforms without signal support, including Windows, the call just
terminates the process with id `pid` in a platform specific way, and the
`signal` parameter is ignored.

Returns `true` if the signal is successfully delivered to the process.
Otherwise the signal could not be sent, usually meaning that the process
is already dead.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external static bool killPid(int pid,
    [ProcessSignal signal = ProcessSignal.sigterm]);
```
