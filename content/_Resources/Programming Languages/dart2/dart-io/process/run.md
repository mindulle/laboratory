:::

Starts a process and runs it non-interactively to completion. The
process run is `executable` with the specified `arguments`.

Use `workingDirectory` to set the working directory for the process.
Note that the change of directory occurs before executing the process on
some platforms, which may have impact when using relative paths for the
executable and the arguments.

Use `environment` to set the environment variables for the process. If
not set the environment of the parent process is inherited. Currently,
only US-ASCII environment variables are supported and errors are likely
to occur if an environment variable with code-points outside the
US-ASCII range is passed in.

If `includeParentEnvironment` is `true`, the process\'s environment will
include the parent process\'s environment, with `environment` taking
precedence. Default is `true`.

If `runInShell` is true, the process will be spawned through a system
shell. On Linux and OS X, `/bin/sh` is used, while
`%WINDIR%\system32\cmd.exe` is used on Windows.

The encoding used for decoding `stdout` and `stderr` into text is
controlled through `stdoutEncoding` and `stderrEncoding`. The default
encoding is [systemEncoding](../systemencoding-constant). If `null` is
used no decoding will happen and the `ProcessResult` will hold binary
data.

Returns a `Future<ProcessResult>` that completes with the result of
running the process, i.e., exit code, standard out and standard in.

The following code uses `Process.run` to grep for `main` in the file
`test.dart` on Linux.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
var result = await Process.run('grep', ['-i', 'main', 'test.dart']);
stdout.write(result.stdout);
stderr.write(result.stderr);
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external static Future<ProcessResult> run(
    String executable, List<String> arguments,
    {String? workingDirectory,
    Map<String, String>? environment,
    bool includeParentEnvironment = true,
    bool runInShell = false,
    Encoding? stdoutEncoding = systemEncoding,
    Encoding? stderrEncoding = systemEncoding});
```
