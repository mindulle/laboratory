[Uri](../../dart-core/uri-class) uri
:::

A [Uri](../../dart-core/uri-class) representing the file system
entity\'s location.

The returned URI\'s scheme is always \"file\" if the entity\'s
[path](path) is absolute, otherwise the scheme will be empty and the URI
relative.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Uri get uri => new Uri.file(path);
```
