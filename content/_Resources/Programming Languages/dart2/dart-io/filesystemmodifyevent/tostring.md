toString method

[String](../../dart-core/string-class) toString()

:::

A string representation of this object.

Some classes have a default textual representation, often paired with a
static `parse` function (like [int.parse](../../dart-core/int/parse)).
These classes will provide the textual representation as their string
representation.

Other classes have no meaningful textual representation that a program
will care about. Such classes will typically override `toString` to
provide useful information when inspecting the object, mainly for
debugging or logging.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
String toString() =>
    "FileSystemModifyEvent('$path', contentChanged=$contentChanged)";
```
