Constructs a new secure client socket and connects it to the given
`host` on port `port`.

The returned Future will complete with a `SecureSocket` that is
connected and ready for subscription.

The certificate provided by the server is checked using the trusted
certificates set in the SecurityContext object. The default
SecurityContext object contains a built-in set of trusted root
certificates for well-known certificate authorities.

`onBadCertificate` is an optional handler for unverifiable certificates.
The handler receives the [X509Certificate](../x509certificate-class),
and can inspect it and decide (or let the user decide) whether to accept
the connection or not. The handler should return true to continue the
`SecureSocket` connection.

`keyLog` is an optional callback that will be called when new TLS keys
are exchanged with the server. `keyLog` will receive one line of text in
[NSS Key Log
Format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format)
for each call. Writing these lines to a file will allow tools (such as
[Wireshark](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/TLS#tls-decryption))
to decrypt content sent through this socket. This is meant to allow
network-level debugging of secure sockets and should not be used in
production code. For example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final log = File('keylog.txt');
final socket = await SecureSocket.connect('www.example.com', 443,
    keyLog: (line) => log.writeAsStringSync(line, mode: FileMode.append));
```

`supportedProtocols` is an optional list of protocols (in decreasing
order of preference) to use during the ALPN protocol negotiation with
the server. Example values are \"http/1.1\" or \"h2\". The selected
protocol can be obtained via
[SecureSocket.selectedProtocol](selectedprotocol).

The argument `timeout` is used to specify the maximum allowed time to
wait for a connection to be established. If `timeout` is longer than the
system level timeout duration, a timeout may occur sooner than specified
in `timeout`. On timeout, a [SocketException](../socketexception-class)
is thrown and all ongoing connection attempts to `host` are cancelled.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static Future<SecureSocket> connect(host, int port,
    {SecurityContext? context,
    bool onBadCertificate(X509Certificate certificate)?,
    void keyLog(String line)?,
    List<String>? supportedProtocols,
    Duration? timeout}) {
  return RawSecureSocket.connect(host, port,
          context: context,
          onBadCertificate: onBadCertificate,
          keyLog: keyLog,
          supportedProtocols: supportedProtocols,
          timeout: timeout)
      .then((rawSocket) => new SecureSocket._(rawSocket));
}
```
