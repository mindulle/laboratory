HttpClientRequest class
=======================

HTTP request for a client connection.

To set up a request, set the headers using the headers property provided
in this class and write the data to the body of the request.
`HttpClientRequest` is an [IOSink](iosink-class). Use the methods from
IOSink, such as `writeCharCode()`, to write the body of the HTTP
request. When one of the IOSink methods is used for the first time, the
request header is sent. Calling any methods that change the header after
it is sent throws an exception.

When writing string data through the [IOSink](iosink-class) the encoding
used is determined from the \"charset\" parameter of the
\"Content-Type\" header.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
var client = HttpClient();
HttpClientRequest request = await client.get('localhost', 80, '/file.txt');
request.headers.contentType =
    ContentType('application', 'json', charset: 'utf-8');
request.write('text contentüëçüéØ'); // Strings written will be UTF-8 encoded.
```

If no charset is provided the default of ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) is used.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
var client = HttpClient();
HttpClientRequest request = await client.get('localhost', 80, '/file.txt');
request.headers.add(HttpHeaders.contentTypeHeader, "text/plain");
request.write('bl√•b√¶rgr√∏d'); // Strings written will be ISO-8859-1 encoded
```

An exception is thrown if you use an unsupported encoding and the
`write()` method being used takes a string parameter.
