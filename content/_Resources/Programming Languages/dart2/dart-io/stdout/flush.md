:::

Returns a [Future](../../dart-async/future-class) that completes once
all buffered data is accepted by the underlying
[StreamConsumer](../../dart-async/streamconsumer-class).

This method must not be called while an [addStream](addstream) is
incomplete.

NOTE: This is not necessarily the same as the data being flushed by the
operating system.

--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Future flush() => _sink.flush();
```
