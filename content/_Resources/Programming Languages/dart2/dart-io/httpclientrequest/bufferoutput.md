bufferOutput property
=====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) bufferOutput

::: {.features}
read / write
:::
:::

Gets or sets if the [HttpClientRequest](../httpclientrequest-class)
should buffer output.

Default value is `true`.

**Note**: Disabling buffering of the output can result in very poor
performance, when writing many small chunks.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool bufferOutput = true;
```
