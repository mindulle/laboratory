writeAsBytes method
===================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Future](../../dart-async/future-class)\<[File](../file-class)\>
writeAsBytes(

1.  [List](../../dart-core/list-class)\<[int](../../dart-core/int-class)\>
    bytes,
2.  {[FileMode](../filemode-class) mode = FileMode.write,
3.  [bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) flush = false}

)
:::

Writes a list of bytes to a file.

Opens the file, writes the list of bytes to it, and closes the file.
Returns a `Future<File>` that completes with this `File` object once the
entire operation has completed.

By default [writeAsBytes](writeasbytes) creates the file for writing and
truncates the file if it already exists. In order to append the bytes to
an existing file, pass [FileMode.append](../filemode/append-constant) as
the optional mode parameter.

If the argument `flush` is set to `true`, the data written will be
flushed to the file system before the returned future completes.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Future<File> writeAsBytes(List<int> bytes,
    {FileMode mode = FileMode.write, bool flush = false});
```
