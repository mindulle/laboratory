Renames this file.

Returns a `Future<File>` that completes with a `File` for the renamed
file.

If `newPath` is a relative path, it is resolved against the current
working directory ([Directory.current](../directory/current)). This
means that simply changing the name of a file, but keeping it the
original directory, requires creating a new complete path with the new
name at the end. Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Future<File> changeFileNameOnly(File file, String newFileName) {
  var path = file.path;
  var lastSeparator = path.lastIndexOf(Platform.pathSeparator);
  var newPath = path.substring(0, lastSeparator + 1) + newFileName;
  return file.rename(newPath);
}
```

On some platforms, a rename operation cannot move a file between
different file systems. If that is the case, instead [copy](copy) the
file to the new location and then remove the original.

If `newPath` identifies an existing file, that file is removed first. If
`newPath` identifies an existing directory, the operation fails and the
future completes with an exception.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Future<File> rename(String newPath);
```
