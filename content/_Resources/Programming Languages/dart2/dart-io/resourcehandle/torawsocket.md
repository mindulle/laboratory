toRawSocket method
==================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[RawSocket](../rawsocket-class) toRawSocket()
:::

Extracts opened raw socket from resource handle.

If this resource handle is not a socket handle, the behavior of the
returned [RawSocket](../rawsocket-class) is completely unspecified. Be
very careful to avoid using a handle incorrectly.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
RawSocket toRawSocket();
```
