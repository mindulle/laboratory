===============

::: {#setter .section .multi-line-signature}
void global=([HttpOverrides](../httpoverrides-class)? overrides)
:::

The [HttpOverrides](../httpoverrides-class) to use in the root
[Zone](../../dart-async/zone-class).

These are the [HttpOverrides](../httpoverrides-class) that will be used
in the root Zone, and in Zone\'s that do not set
[HttpOverrides](../httpoverrides-class) and whose ancestors up to the
root Zone do not set [HttpOverrides](../httpoverrides-class).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static set global(HttpOverrides? overrides) {
  _global = overrides;
}
```
