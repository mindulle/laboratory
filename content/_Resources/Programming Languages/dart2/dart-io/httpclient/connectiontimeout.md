connectionTimeout property
==========================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Duration](../../dart-core/duration-class)? connectionTimeout

::: {.features}
read / write
:::
:::

Gets and sets the connection timeout.

When connecting to a new host exceeds this timeout, a
[SocketException](../socketexception-class) is thrown. The timeout
applies only to connections initiated after the timeout is set.

When this is `null`, the OS default timeout is used. The default is
`null`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Duration? connectionTimeout;
```
