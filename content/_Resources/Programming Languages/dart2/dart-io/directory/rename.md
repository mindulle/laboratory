)

Renames this directory.

Returns a `Future<Directory>` that completes with a `Directory` for the
renamed directory.

If `newPath` identifies an existing directory, then the behavior is
platform-specific. On all platforms, the future completes with a
[FileSystemException](../filesystemexception-class) if the existing
directory is not empty. On POSIX systems, if `newPath` identifies an
existing empty directory then that directory is deleted before this
directory is renamed.

If `newPath` identifies an existing file, the operation fails and the
future completes with a
[FileSystemException](../filesystemexception-class).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Future<Directory> rename(String newPath);
```
