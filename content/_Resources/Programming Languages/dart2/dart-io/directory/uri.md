A [Uri](../../dart-core/uri-class) representing the directory\'s

The URI\'s scheme is always \"file\" if the entity\'s [path](path) is
absolute, otherwise the scheme will be empty and the URI relative. The
URI\'s path always ends in a slash (\'/\').

Implementation {#source}

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Uri get uri;
```
