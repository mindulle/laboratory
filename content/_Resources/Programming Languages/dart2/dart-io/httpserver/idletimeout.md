idleTimeout property
====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Duration](../../dart-core/duration-class)? idleTimeout

::: {.features}
read / write
:::
:::

Gets or sets the timeout used for idle keep-alive connections. If no
further request is seen within [idleTimeout](idletimeout) after the
previous request was completed, the connection is dropped.

Default is 120 seconds.

Note that it may take up to `2 * idleTimeout` before a idle connection
is aborted.

To disable, set [idleTimeout](idletimeout) to `null`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Duration? idleTimeout = const Duration(seconds: 120);
```
