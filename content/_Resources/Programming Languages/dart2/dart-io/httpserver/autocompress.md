autoCompress property
=====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) autoCompress

::: {.features}

:::

Whether the [HttpServer](../httpserver-class) should compress the
content, if possible.

The content can only be compressed when the response is using chunked
Transfer-Encoding and the incoming request has `gzip` as an accepted
encoding in the Accept-Encoding header.

The default value is `false` (compression disabled). To enable, set
`autoCompress` to `true`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool autoCompress = false;
```
