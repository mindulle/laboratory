script property
===============

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[Uri](../../dart-core/uri-class) script
:::

The absolute URI of the script being run in this isolate.

If the script argument on the command line is relative, it is resolved
to an absolute URI before fetching the script, and that absolute URI is
returned.

URI resolution only does string manipulation on the script path, and
this may be different from the file system\'s path resolution behavior.
For example, a symbolic link immediately followed by \'..\' will not be
looked up.

If a compiled Dart script is being executed the URI to the compiled
script is returned, for example, `file:///full/path/to/script_name.exe`.

If running on the Dart VM the URI to the running Dart script is
returned, for example, `file:///full/path/to/script_name.dart`.

If the executable environment does not support [script](script), the URI
is empty.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static Uri get script => _Platform.script;
```
