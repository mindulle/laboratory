:::

Set and get the [deadline](deadline) for the response. The deadline is
timed from the time it\'s set. Setting a new deadline will override any
previous deadline. When a deadline is exceeded, the response will be
closed and any further data ignored.

To disable a deadline, set the [deadline](deadline) to `null`.

The [deadline](deadline) is `null` by default.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Duration? deadline;
```
