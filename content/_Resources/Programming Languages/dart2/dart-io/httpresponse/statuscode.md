statusCode property
===================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[int](../../dart-core/int-class) statusCode

::: {.features}
read / write
:::
:::

The status code of the response.

Any integer value is accepted. For the official HTTP status codes use
the fields from [HttpStatus](../../dart-html/httpstatus-class). If no
status code is explicitly set the default value
[HttpStatus.ok](../../dart-html/httpstatus/ok-constant) is used.

The status code must be set before the body is written to. Setting the
status code after writing to the response body or closing the response
will throw a `StateError`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
int statusCode = HttpStatus.ok;
```
