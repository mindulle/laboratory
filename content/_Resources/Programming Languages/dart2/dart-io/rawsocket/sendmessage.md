Writes socket control messages and data bytes to the socket.

Writes `controlMessages` and up to `count` bytes of `data`, starting at
`offset`, to the socket. If `count` is not provided, as many bytes as
possible are written. Use [write](write) instead if no control messages
are required to be sent.

When sent control messages are received, they are retained until the
next call to [readMessage](readmessage), where all currently available
control messages are provided as part of the returned
[SocketMessage](../socketmessage-class). Calling [read](read) will read
only data bytes, and will not affect control messages.

The `count` must be positive (greater than zero).

Returns the number of bytes written, which cannot be greater than
`count`, nor greater than `data.length - offset`. Return value of zero
indicates that control messages were not sent.

This function is non-blocking and will only write data if buffer space
is available in the socket.

Throws an [OSError](../oserror-class) if message could not be sent out.

Unsupported by [RawSecureSocket](../rawsecuresocket-class).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
@Since("2.15")
int sendMessage(List<SocketControlMessage> controlMessages, List<int> data,
    [int offset = 0, int? count]);
```
