[SocketMessage](../socketmessage-class)? readMessage(

:::

Reads a message containing up to `count` bytes from the socket.

This function differs from [read](read) in that it will also return any
[SocketControlMessage](../socketcontrolmessage-class) that have been
sent.

This function is non-blocking and will only return data if data is
available. The number of bytes read can be less then `count` if fewer
bytes are available for immediate reading. Length of data buffer in
[SocketMessage](../socketmessage-class) indicates number of bytes read.

Returns `null` if no data is available.

Unsupported by [RawSecureSocket](../rawsecuresocket-class).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
@Since("2.15")
SocketMessage? readMessage([int? count]);
```
