startConnect method
===================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Future](../../dart-async/future-class)\<[ConnectionTask](../connectiontask-class)\<[RawSocket](../rawsocket-class)\>\>
startConnect(

1.  dynamic host,
2.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) port,
3.  {dynamic sourceAddress,
4.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) sourcePort = 0}

)
:::

Like [connect](connect), but returns a
[Future](../../dart-async/future-class) that completes with a
`ConnectionTask` that can be cancelled if the
[RawSocket](../rawsocket-class) is no longer needed.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external static Future<ConnectionTask<RawSocket>> startConnect(host, int port,
    {sourceAddress, int sourcePort = 0});
```
