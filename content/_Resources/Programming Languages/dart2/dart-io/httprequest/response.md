response property
=================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[HttpResponse](../httpresponse-class) response
:::

The [HttpResponse](../httpresponse-class) object, used for sending back
the response to the client.

If the [contentLength](contentlength) of the body isn\'t 0, and the body
isn\'t being read, any write calls on the
[HttpResponse](../httpresponse-class) automatically drain the request
body.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
HttpResponse get response;
```
