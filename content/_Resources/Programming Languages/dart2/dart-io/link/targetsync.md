targetSync method
=================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[String](../../dart-core/string-class) targetSync()
:::

Synchronously gets the target of the link.

Returns the path to the target.

If the returned target is a relative path, it is relative to the
directory containing the link.

If the link does not exist, or is not a link, throws a
[FileSystemException](../filesystemexception-class).

```
