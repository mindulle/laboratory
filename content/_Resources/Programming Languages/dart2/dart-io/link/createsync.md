createSync method
=================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void createSync(

1.  [String](../../dart-core/string-class) target,
2.  {[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) recursive = false}

)
:::

Synchronously create the link. Calling [createSync](createsync) on an
existing link will throw an exception.

If `recursive` is `false`, the default, the link is created only if all
directories in its path exist. If `recursive` is `true`, all
non-existing parent paths are created first. The directories in the path
of `target` are not affected, unless they are also in
[path](../filesystementity/path).

On the Windows platform, this call will create a true symbolic link
instead of a Junction. In order to create a symbolic link on Windows,
Dart must be run in Administrator mode or the system must have Developer
Mode enabled, otherwise a
[FileSystemException](../filesystemexception-class) will be raised with
`ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD` set as the errno when this call is made.

On other platforms, the POSIX `symlink()` call is used to make a
symbolic link containing the string `target`. If `target` is a relative
path, it will be interpreted relative to the directory containing the
link.

--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void createSync(String target, {bool recursive = false});
```
