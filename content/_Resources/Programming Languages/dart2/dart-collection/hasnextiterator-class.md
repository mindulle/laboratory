HasNextIterator\<E\> class
==========================

The [HasNextIterator](hasnextiterator-class) class wraps an
[Iterator](../dart-core/iterator-class) and provides methods to iterate
over an object using `hasNext` and `next`.

An [HasNextIterator](hasnextiterator-class) does not implement the
[Iterator](../dart-core/iterator-class) interface.
