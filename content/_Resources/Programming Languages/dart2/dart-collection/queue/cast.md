cast\<R\> method

[Queue](../queue-class)\<R\> cast\<R\>()

::: {.features}

:::

Provides a view of this queue as a queue of `R` instances, if necessary.

If this queue contains only instances of `R`, all read operations will
work correctly. If any operation tries to access an element that is not
an instance of `R`, the access will throw instead.

Elements added to the queue (e.g., by using [addFirst](addfirst) or
[addAll](addall)) must be instances of `R` to be valid arguments to the
adding function, and they must also be instances of `E` to be accepted
by this queue as well.

Methods which accept `Object?` as argument, like
[contains](../../dart-core/iterable/contains) and [remove](remove), will
pass the argument directly to the this queue\'s method without any
checks. That means that you can do
`queueOfStrings.cast<int>().remove("a")` successfully, even if it looks
like it shouldn\'t have any effect.
