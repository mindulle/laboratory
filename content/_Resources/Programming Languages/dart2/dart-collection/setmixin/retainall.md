:::

Removes all elements of this set that are not elements in `elements`.

Checks for each element of `elements` whether there is an element in
this set that is equal to it (according to `this.contains`), and if so,
the equal element in this set is retained, and elements that are not
equal to any element in `elements` are removed.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final characters = <String>{'A', 'B', 'C'};
characters.retainAll({'A', 'B', 'X'});
print(characters); // {A, B}
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void retainAll(Iterable<Object?> elements) {
  // Create a copy of the set, remove all of elements from the copy,
  // then remove all remaining elements in copy from this.
  Set<E> toRemove = toSet();
  for (Object? o in elements) {
    toRemove.remove(o);
  }
  removeAll(toRemove);
}
```
