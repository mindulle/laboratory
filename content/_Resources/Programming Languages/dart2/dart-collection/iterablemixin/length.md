length property
===============

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[int](../../dart-core/int-class) length

::: {.features}
override
:::
:::

Returns the number of elements in [this](../iterablemixin-class).

Counting all elements may involve iterating through all elements and can
therefore be slow. Some iterables have a more efficient way to find the
number of elements.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
int get length {
  assert(this is! EfficientLengthIterable);
  int count = 0;
  Iterator it = iterator;
  while (it.moveNext()) {
    count++;
  }
  return count;
}
```
