cast\<R\> method
================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Iterable](../../dart-core/iterable-class)\<R\> cast\<R\>()

::: {.features}
override
:::
:::

Provides a view of this iterable as an iterable of `R` instances.

If this iterable only contains instances of `R`, all operations will
work correctly. If any operation tries to access an element that is not
an instance of `R`, the access will throw instead.

When the returned iterable creates a new object that depends on the type
`R`, e.g., from [toList](tolist), it will have exactly the type `R`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Iterable<R> cast<R>() => Iterable.castFrom<E, R>(this);
```
