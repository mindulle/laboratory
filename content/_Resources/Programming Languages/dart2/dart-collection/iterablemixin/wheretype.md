whereType\<T\> method
=====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Iterable](../../dart-core/iterable-class)\<T\> whereType\<T\>()

::: {.features}
override
:::
:::

Returns a new lazy [Iterable](../../dart-core/iterable-class) with all
elements that have type `T`.

The matching elements have the same order in the returned iterable as
they have in [iterator](../../dart-core/iterable/iterator).

This method returns a view of the mapped elements. Iterating will not
cache results, and thus iterating multiple times over the returned
[Iterable](../../dart-core/iterable-class) may yield different results,
if the underlying elements change between iterations.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Iterable<T> whereType<T>() => WhereTypeIterable<T>(this);
```
