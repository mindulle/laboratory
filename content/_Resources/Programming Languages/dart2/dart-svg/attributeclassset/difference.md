Creates a new set with the elements of this that are not in `other`.

That is, the returned set contains all the elements of this
[Set](../../dart-core/set-class) that are not elements of `other`
according to `other.contains`.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final characters1 = <String>{'A', 'B', 'C'};
final characters2 = <String>{'A', 'E', 'F'};
final differenceSet1 = characters1.difference(characters2);
print(differenceSet1); // {B, C}
final differenceSet2 = characters2.difference(characters1);
print(differenceSet2); // {E, F}
```

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Set<String> difference(Set<Object?> other) => readClasses().difference(other);
```
