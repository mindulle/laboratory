:::

Returns a lazy iterable of the `count` first elements of this iterable.

The returned `Iterable` may contain fewer than `count` elements, if
`this` contains fewer than `count` elements.

The elements can be computed by stepping through [iterator](iterator)
until `count` elements have been seen.

The `count` must not be negative.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final numbers = <int>[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7];
final result = numbers.take(4); // (1, 2, 3, 5)
final takeAll = numbers.take(100); // (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Iterable<String> take(int n) => readClasses().take(n);
```
