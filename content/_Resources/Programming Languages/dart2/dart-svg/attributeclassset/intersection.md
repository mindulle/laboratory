Creates a new set which is the intersection between this set and
`other`.

That is, the returned set contains all the elements of this
[Set](../../dart-core/set-class) that are also elements of `other`
according to `other.contains`.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final characters1 = <String>{'A', 'B', 'C'};
final characters2 = <String>{'A', 'E', 'F'};
final unionSet = characters1.intersection(characters2);
print(unionSet); // {A}
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Set<String> intersection(Set<Object?> other) =>
    readClasses().intersection(other);
```
