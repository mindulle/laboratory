Creates a new set which contains all the elements of this set and
`other`.

That is, the returned set contains all the elements of this
[Set](../../dart-core/set-class) and all the elements of `other`.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final characters1 = <String>{'A', 'B', 'C'};
final characters2 = <String>{'A', 'E', 'F'};
final unionSet1 = characters1.union(characters2);
print(unionSet1); // {A, B, C, E, F}
final unionSet2 = characters2.union(characters1);
print(unionSet2); // {A, E, F, B, C}
```

Implementation {#source}

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Set<String> union(Set<String> other) => readClasses().union(other);
```
