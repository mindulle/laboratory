:::

Returns the concatenation of this list and `other`.

If `other` is also a [Int32x4List](../int32x4list-class), the result is
a new [Int32x4List](../int32x4list-class), otherwise the result is a
normal growable `List<Int32x4>`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
List<Int32x4> operator +(List<Int32x4> other);
```
