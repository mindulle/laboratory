dart:typed\_data library
========================

Lists that efficiently handle fixed sized data (for example, unsigned 8
byte integers) and SIMD numeric types.

To use this library in your code:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:typed_data';
```

Classes
-------

[ByteBuffer](bytebuffer-class)
:   A sequence of bytes underlying a typed data object.

[ByteData](bytedata-class)
:   A fixed-length, random-access sequence of bytes that also provides
    random and unaligned access to the fixed-width integers and floating
    point numbers represented by those bytes.

[BytesBuilder](bytesbuilder-class)
:   Builds a list of bytes, allowing bytes and lists of bytes to be
    added at the end.

[Endian](endian-class)
:   Describes endianness to be used when accessing or updating a
    sequence of bytes.

[Float32List](float32list-class)
:   A fixed-length list of IEEE 754 single-precision binary
    floating-point numbers that is viewable as a
    [TypedData](typeddata-class).

[Float32x4](float32x4-class)
:   Float32x4 immutable value type and operations.

[Float32x4List](float32x4list-class)
