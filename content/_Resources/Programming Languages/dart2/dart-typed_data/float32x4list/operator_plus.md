:::

Returns the concatenation of this list and `other`.

If `other` is also a [Float32x4List](../float32x4list-class), the result
is a new [Float32x4List](../float32x4list-class), otherwise the result
is a normal growable `List<Float32x4>`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
List<Float32x4> operator +(List<Float32x4> other);
```
