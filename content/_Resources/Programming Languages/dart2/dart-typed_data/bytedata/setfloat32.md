setFloat32 method
=================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void setFloat32(

1.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) byteOffset,
2.  [double](../../dart-core/double-class) value,
3.  \[[Endian](../endian-class) endian = Endian.big\]

)
:::

Sets the four bytes starting at the specified `byteOffset` in this
object to the IEEE 754 single-precision binary floating-point (binary32)
representation of the specified `value`.

**Note that this method can lose precision.** The input `value` is a
64-bit floating point value, which will be converted to 32-bit floating
point value by IEEE 754 rounding rules before it is stored. If `value`
cannot be represented exactly as a binary32, it will be converted to the
nearest binary32 value. If two binary32 values are equally close, the
one whose least significant bit is zero will be used. Note that finite
(but large) values can be converted to infinity, and small non-zero
values can be converted to zero.

The `byteOffset` must be non-negative, and `byteOffset + 4` must be less
than or equal to the length of this object.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void setFloat32(int byteOffset, double value, [Endian endian = Endian.big]);
```
