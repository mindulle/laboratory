shuffleMix method
=================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Float32x4](../float32x4-class) shuffleMix(

1.  [Float32x4](../float32x4-class) other,
2.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) mask

)
:::

Shuffle the lane values in [this](../float32x4-class) and `other`. The
returned Float32x4 will have XY lanes from [this](../float32x4-class)
and ZW lanes from `other`. Uses the same `mask` as [shuffle](shuffle).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Float32x4 shuffleMix(Float32x4 other, int mask);
```
