\@JSName(\'drawImage\')
:::
:::

Draws an image from a CanvasImageSource to an area of this canvas.

The image is a region of `source` that is `sourceWidth` wide and
`destHeight` tall with top left corner at (`sourceX`, `sourceY`). The
image will be drawn to this context with its top left corner at the
point (`destX`, `destY`) and will be scaled to be `destWidth` wide and
`destHeight` tall.

If the image is larger than canvas will allow, the image will be clipped
to fit the available space.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
VideoElement video = document.query('video');
video.width = 100;
video.height = 100;
// Take the middle 20x20 pixels from the video and stretch them.
ctx.drawImageScaledFromSource(video, 40, 40, 20, 20, 50, 50, 100, 100);

// Draw the top 100x20 pixels from the otherCanvas to this one.
CanvasElement otherCanvas = document.query('canvas');
ctx.drawImageScaledFromSource(otherCanvas, 0, 0, 100, 20, 0, 0, 100, 20);
```
