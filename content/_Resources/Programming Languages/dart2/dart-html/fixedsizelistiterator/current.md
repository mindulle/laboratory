The current element.

If the iterator has not yet been moved to the first element
([moveNext](movenext) has not been called yet), or if the iterator has
been moved past the last element of the
[Iterable](../../dart-core/iterable-class) ([moveNext](movenext) has
returned false), then [current](current) is unspecified. An
[Iterator](../../dart-core/iterator-class) may either throw or return an
iterator specific default value in that case.

The `current` getter should keep its value until the next call to
[moveNext](movenext), even if an underlying collection changes. After a
successful call to `moveNext`, the user doesn\'t need to cache the
current value, but can keep reading it from the iterator.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final colors = ['blue', 'yellow', 'red'];
var colorsIterator = colors.iterator;
while (colorsIterator.moveNext()) {
  print(colorsIterator.current);
}
```

The output of the example is:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
blue
yellow
red
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
T get current => _current as T;
```
