UriPolicy constructor
=====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
UriPolicy()
:::

Constructs the default UriPolicy which is to only allow Uris to the same
origin as the application was launched from.

This will block all ftp: mailto: URIs. It will also block accessing
<https://example.com> if the app is running from <http://example.com>.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
factory UriPolicy() => new _SameOriginUriPolicy();
```
