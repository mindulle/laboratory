capture method
==============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[StreamSubscription](../../dart-async/streamsubscription-class)\<T\>
capture(

1.  void onData(
    1.  T event

    )

)
:::

Adds a capturing subscription to this stream.

If the target of the event is a descendant of the element from which
this stream derives then `onData` is called before the event propagates
down to the target. This is the opposite of bubbling behavior, where the
event is first processed for the event target and then bubbles upward.
