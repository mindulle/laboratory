operator \[\] method
====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Map](../../dart-core/map-class)? operator \[\](

)

The value for the given `key`, or `null` if `key` is not in the map.

Some maps allow `null` as a value. For those maps, a lookup using this
operator cannot distinguish between a key not being in the map, and the
key being there with a `null` value. Methods like
[containsKey](containskey) or [putIfAbsent](putifabsent) can be used if
the distinction is important.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Map? operator [](dynamic key) => _getItem(key);
```
