dragEvent constant
==================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[EventStreamProvider](../eventstreamprovider-class)\<[MouseEvent](../mouseevent-class)\>
const dragEvent
:::

A stream of `drag` events fired when an element is currently being
dragged.

A `drag` event is added to this stream as soon as the drag begins. A
`drag` event is also added to this stream at intervals while the drag
operation is still ongoing.
