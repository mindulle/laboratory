loadEvent constant
==================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[EventStreamProvider](../eventstreamprovider-class)\<[Event](../event-class)\>
const loadEvent
:::

Static factory designed to expose `load` events to event handlers that
are not necessarily instances of [Element](../element-class).

See [EventStreamProvider](../eventstreamprovider-class) for usage
information.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static const EventStreamProvider<Event> loadEvent =
    const EventStreamProvider<Event>('load');
```
