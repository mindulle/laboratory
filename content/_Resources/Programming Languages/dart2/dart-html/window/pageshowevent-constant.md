======================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[EventStreamProvider](../eventstreamprovider-class)\<[Event](../event-class)\>
const pageShowEvent

Static factory designed to expose `pageshow` events to event handlers
that are not necessarily instances of [Window](../window-class).

See [EventStreamProvider](../eventstreamprovider-class) for usage
information.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static const EventStreamProvider<Event> pageShowEvent =
    const EventStreamProvider<Event>('pageshow');
```
