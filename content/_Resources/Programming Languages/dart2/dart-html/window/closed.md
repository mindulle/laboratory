Indicates whether this window has been closed.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
print(window.closed); // 'false'
window.close();
print(window.closed); // 'true'
```

MDN does not have compatibility info on this attribute, and therefore is
marked nullable.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool? get closed native;
```
