window top-level property
=========================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[Window](window-class) window
:::

Top-level container for a web page, which is usually a browser tab or
window.

Each web page loaded in the browser has its own [Window](window-class),
which is a container for the web page.

If the web page has any `<iframe>` elements, then each `<iframe>` has
its own [Window](window-class) object, which is accessible only to that
`<iframe>`.

```
