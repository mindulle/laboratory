Checks that this iterable has only one element, and returns that
element.

Throws a [StateError](../../dart-core/stateerror-class) if `this` is
empty or has more than one element.

Implementation {#source}

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Rectangle get single {
  int len = this.length;
  if (len == 1) {
    return JS('Rectangle', '#[0]', this);
  }
  if (len == 0) throw new StateError("No elements");
  throw new StateError("More than one element");
}
```
