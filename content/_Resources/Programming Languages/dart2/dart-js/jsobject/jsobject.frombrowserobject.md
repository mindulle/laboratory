JsObject.fromBrowserObject constructor
======================================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
JsObject.fromBrowserObject(

1.  [Object](../../dart-core/object-class) object

)
:::

Constructs a [JsObject](../jsobject-class) that proxies a native Dart
object; *for expert use only*.

Use this constructor only if you wish to get access to JavaScript
properties attached to a browser host object, such as a Node or Blob,
that is normally automatically converted into a native Dart object.

An exception will be thrown if `object` has the type `bool`, `num`, or
`String`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external factory JsObject.fromBrowserObject(Object object);
```
