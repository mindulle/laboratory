:::

Whether `other` is a point with the same coordinates as this point.

Returns `true` if `other` is a [Point](../point-class) with [x](x) and
[y](y) coordinates equal to the corresponding coordinates of this point,
and `false` otherwise.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
var result = const Point(0, 0) == const Point(0, 0); // true
result = const Point(1.0, 0) == const Point(-1.0, 0); // false
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool operator ==(Object other) =>
    other is Point && x == other.x && y == other.y;
```
