operator + method
=================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Point](../point-class)\<T\> operator +(

1.  [Point](../point-class)\<T\> other

)
:::

Add `other` to `this`, as if both points were vectors.

Returns the resulting \"vector\" as a Point.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
var point = const Point(10, 100) + const Point(10, 10); // Point(20, 110)
point = const Point(-10, -20) + const Point(10, 100); // Point(0, 80)
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Point<T> operator +(Point<T> other) {
  return Point<T>((x + other.x) as T, (y + other.y) as T);
}
```
