tan function
============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[double](../dart-core/double-class) tan(

1.  [num](../dart-core/num-class) radians

)
:::

Converts `radians` to a [double](../dart-core/double-class) and returns
the tangent of the value.

The tangent function is equivalent to `sin(radians)/cos(radians)` and
may be infinite (positive or negative) when `cos(radians)` is equal to
zero. If `radians` is not a finite number, the result is NaN.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external double tan(num radians);
```
