load method
===========

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Future](../future-class)\<[Null](../../dart-core/null-class)\> load()
:::

Ensure that [libraryName](libraryname) has been loaded.

If the library fails to load, the [Future](../future-class) will
complete with a [DeferredLoadException](../deferredloadexception-class).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external Future<Null> load();
```
