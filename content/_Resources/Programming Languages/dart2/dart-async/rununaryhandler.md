RunUnaryHandler typedef
=======================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
RunUnaryHandler = R Function\<R, T\>([Zone](zone-class) self,
[ZoneDelegate](zonedelegate-class) parent, [Zone](zone-class) zone, R
f(T arg), T arg)
:::

The type of a custom [Zone.runUnary](zone/rununary) implementation
function.

Receives the [Zone](zone-class) that the handler was registered on as
`self`, a delegate forwarding to the handlers of `self`\'s parent zone
as `parent`, and the current zone where the error was uncaught as
`zone`, which will have `self` as a parent zone.

The function `f` and value `arg` are the function and argument which was
passed to the [Zone.runUnary](zone/rununary) of `zone`.

The default behavior of [Zone.runUnary](zone/rununary) is to call `f`
with argument `arg` in the current zone, `zone`. A custom handler can do
things before, after or instead of calling `f`.

The function must only access zone-related functionality through `self`,
`parent` or `zone`. It should not depend on the current zone
([Zone.current](zone/current)).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
typedef RunUnaryHandler = R Function<R, T>(
    Zone self, ZoneDelegate parent, Zone zone, R Function(T arg) f, T arg);
```
