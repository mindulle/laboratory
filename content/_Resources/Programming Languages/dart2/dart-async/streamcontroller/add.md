void add(

:::

Sends a data `event`.

Listeners receive this event in a later microtask.

Note that a synchronous controller (created by passing true to the
`sync` parameter of the `StreamController` constructor) delivers events
immediately. Since this behavior violates the contract mentioned here,
synchronous controllers should only be used as described in the
documentation to ensure that the delivered events always *appear* as if
they were delivered in a separate microtask.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void add(T event);
```
