bind method
===========

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Stream](../stream-class)\<T\> bind(

1.  [Stream](../stream-class)\<S\> stream

)
:::

Transforms the provided `stream`.

Returns a new stream with events that are computed from events of the
provided `stream`.

The [StreamTransformer](../streamtransformer-class) interface is
completely generic, so it cannot say what subclasses do. Each
[StreamTransformer](../streamtransformer-class) should document clearly
how it transforms the stream (on the class or variable used to access
the transformer), as well as any differences from the following typical
behavior:

-   When the returned stream is listened to, it starts listening to the
    input `stream`.
-   Subscriptions of the returned stream forward (in a reasonable time)
    a [StreamSubscription.pause](../streamsubscription/pause) call to
    the subscription of the input `stream`.
-   Similarly, canceling a subscription of the returned stream
    eventually (in reasonable time) cancels the subscription of the
    input `stream`.

\"Reasonable time\" depends on the transformer and stream. Some
transformers, like a \"timeout\" transformer, might make these
operations depend on a duration. Others might not delay them at all, or
just by a microtask.

Transformers are free to handle errors in any way. A transformer
implementation may choose to propagate errors, or convert them to other
events, or ignore them completely, but if errors are ignored, it should
be documented explicitly.

--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Stream<T> bind(Stream<S> stream);
```
