onDone method
=============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void onDone(

1.  void handleDone( )?

)
:::

Replaces the done event handler of this subscription.

The `handleDone` function is called when the stream closes. The value
may be `null`, in which case no function is called.

This method replaces the current handler set by the invocation of
[Stream.listen](../stream/listen), by calling [asFuture](asfuture), or
by a previous call to [onDone](ondone).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void onDone(void handleDone()?);
```
