isPaused property
=================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) isPaused
:::

Whether the [StreamSubscription](../streamsubscription-class) is
currently paused.

If there have been more calls to [pause](pause) than to [resume](resume)
on this stream subscription, the subscription is paused, and this getter
returns `true`.

Returns `false` if the stream can currently emit events, or if the
subscription has completed or been cancelled.
