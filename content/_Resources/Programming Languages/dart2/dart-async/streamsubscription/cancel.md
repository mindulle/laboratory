cancel method
=============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Future](../future-class)\<void\> cancel()
:::

Cancels this subscription.

After this call, the subscription no longer receives events.

The stream may need to shut down the source of events and clean up after
the subscription is canceled.

Returns a future that is completed once the stream has finished its
cleanup.

Typically, cleanup happens when the stream needs to release resources.
For example, a stream might need to close an open file (as an
asynchronous operation). If the listener wants to delete the file after
having canceled the subscription, it must wait for the cleanup future to
complete.

If the cleanup throws, which it really shouldn\'t, the returned future
completes with that error.

Implementation {#source}
