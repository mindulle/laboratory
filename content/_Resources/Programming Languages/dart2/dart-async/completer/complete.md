complete method
===============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void complete(

1.  \[[FutureOr](../futureor-class)\<T\>? value\]

)
:::

Completes [future](future) with the supplied values.

The value must be either a value of type `T` or a future of type
`Future<T>`. If the value is omitted or `null`, and `T` is not nullable,
the call to `complete` throws.

If the value is itself a future, the completer will wait for that future
to complete, and complete with the same result, whether it is a success
or an error.

Calling [complete](complete) or [completeError](completeerror) must be
done at most once.

All listeners on the future are informed about the value.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void complete([FutureOr<T>? value]);
```
