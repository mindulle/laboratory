RegisterCallbackHandler typedef
===============================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
RegisterCallbackHandler = [ZoneCallback](zonecallback)\<R\>
Function\<R\>([Zone](zone-class) self,
[ZoneDelegate](zonedelegate-class) parent, [Zone](zone-class) zone, R
f())
:::

The type of a custom [Zone.registerCallback](zone/registercallback)
implementation function.

Receives the [Zone](zone-class) that the handler was registered on as
`self`, a delegate forwarding to the handlers of `self`\'s parent zone
as `parent`, and the current zone where the error was uncaught as
`zone`, which will have `self` as a parent zone.

The function `f` is the function which was passed to the
[Zone.registerCallback](zone/registercallback) of `zone`.

The handler should return either the function `f` or another function
replacing `f`, typically by wrapping `f` in a function which does
something extra before and after invoking `f`

The function must only access zone-related functionality through `self`,
`parent` or `zone`. It should not depend on the current zone
([Zone.current](zone/current)).

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
typedef RegisterCallbackHandler = ZoneCallback<R> Function<R>(
    Zone self, ZoneDelegate parent, Zone zone, R Function() f);
```
