unawaited function

Explicitly ignores a future.

Not all futures need to be awaited. The Dart linter has an optional
[\"unawaited futures\"
lint](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/unawaited_futures.html)
which enforces that potential futures (expressions with a static type of
[Future](future-class) or `Future?`) in asynchronous functions are
handled *somehow*. If a particular future value doesn\'t need to be
awaited, you can call `unawaited(...)` with it, which will avoid the
lint, simply because the expression no longer has type
[Future](future-class). Using `unawaited` has no other effect. You
should use `unawaited` to convey the *intention* of deliberately not
waiting for the future.

If the future completes with an error, it was likely a mistake to not
await it. That error will still occur and will be considered unhandled
unless the same future is awaited (or otherwise handled) elsewhere too.
Because of that, `unawaited` should only be used for futures that are
*expected* to complete with a value. You can use
[FutureExtensions.ignore](futureextensions/ignore) if you also don\'t
want to know about errors from this future.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
@Since("2.15")
void unawaited(Future<void>? future) {}
```
