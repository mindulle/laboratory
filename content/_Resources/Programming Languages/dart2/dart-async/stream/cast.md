cast\<R\> method
================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Stream](../stream-class)\<R\> cast\<R\>()
:::

Adapt this stream to be a `Stream<R>`.

This stream is wrapped as a `Stream<R>` which checks at run-time that
each data event emitted by this stream is also an instance of `R`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Stream<R> cast<R>() => Stream.castFrom<T, R>(this);
```
