distinct method
===============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Stream](../stream-class)\<T\> distinct(

1.  \[[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) equals(
    1.  T previous,
    2.  T next

    )?\]

)

Skips data events if they are equal to the previous data event.

The returned stream provides the same events as this stream, except that
it never provides two consecutive data events that are equal. That is,
errors are passed through to the returned stream, and data events are
passed through if they are distinct from the most recently emitted data
event.

Equality is determined by the provided `equals` method. If that is
omitted, the \'==\' operator on the last provided data element is used.

If `equals` throws, the data event is replaced by an error event
containing the thrown error. The behavior is equivalent to the original
stream emitting the error event, and it doesn\'t change the what the
most recently emitted data event is.

The returned stream is a broadcast stream if this stream is. If a
broadcast stream is listened to more than once, each subscription will
individually perform the `equals` test.

Example:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
final stream = Stream.fromIterable([2, 6, 6, 8, 12, 8, 8, 2]).distinct();
stream.forEach(print); // Outputs events: 2,6,8,12,8,2.
```

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Stream<T> distinct([bool equals(T previous, T next)?]) {
  return new _DistinctStream<T>(this, equals);
}
```
