operator \[\] method
====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
dynamic operator \[\](

1.  [Object](../../dart-core/object-class)? key

)
:::

Retrieves the zone-value associated with `key`.

If this zone does not contain the value looks up the same key in the
parent zone. If the `key` is not found returns `null`.

Any object can be used as key, as long as it has compatible
`operator ==` and `hashCode` implementations. By controlling access to
the key, a zone can grant or deny access to the zone value.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
dynamic operator [](Object? key);
```
