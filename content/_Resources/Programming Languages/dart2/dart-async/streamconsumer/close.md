close method
============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Future](../future-class) close()
:::

Tells the consumer that no further streams will be added.

This allows the consumer to complete any remaining work and release
resources that are no longer needed

Returns a future which is completed when the consumer has shut down. If
cleaning up can fail, the error may be reported in the returned future,
otherwise it completes with `null`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Future close();
```
