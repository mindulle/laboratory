Future\<T\> constructor
=======================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
Future\<T\>(

1.  [FutureOr](../futureor-class)\<T\> computation( )

)
:::

Creates a future containing the result of calling `computation`
asynchronously with [Timer.run](../timer/run).

If the result of executing `computation` throws, the returned future is
completed with the error.

If the returned value is itself a [Future](../future-class), completion
of the created future will wait until the returned future completes, and
will then complete with the same result.

If a non-future value is returned, the returned future is completed with
that value.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
factory Future(FutureOr<T> computation()) {
  _Future<T> result = new _Future<T>();
  Timer.run(() {
    try {
      result._complete(computation());
    } catch (e, s) {
      _completeWithErrorCallback(result, e, s);
    }
  });
  return result;
}
```
