CreateTimerHandler typedef
==========================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
CreateTimerHandler = [Timer](timer-class) Function([Zone](zone-class)
self, [ZoneDelegate](zonedelegate-class) parent, [Zone](zone-class)
zone, [Duration](../dart-core/duration-class) duration, void f())
:::

The type of a custom [Zone.createTimer](zone/createtimer) implementation
function.

Receives the [Zone](zone-class) that the handler was registered on as
`self`, a delegate forwarding to the handlers of `self`\'s parent zone
as `parent`, and the current zone where the error was uncaught as
`zone`, which will have `self` as a parent zone.

The callback function `f` and `duration` are the ones which were passed
to [Zone.createTimer](zone/createtimer) of `zone` (possibly through the
[Timer](timer-class) constructor).

The custom handler can choose to replace the function `f` with one that
does something before, after or instead of calling `f`, and then call
`parent.createTimer(zone, replacement)`. or it can implement its own
timer queue, which typically still depends on `parent.createTimer` to as
a way to get started.

The function should return a [Timer](timer-class) object which can be
used to inspect and control the scheduled timer callback.

The function must only access zone-related functionality through `self`,
`parent` or `zone`. It should not depend on the current zone
([Zone.current](zone/current)).

typedef Timer CreateTimerHandler(
    Zone self, ZoneDelegate parent, Zone zone, Duration duration, void f());
