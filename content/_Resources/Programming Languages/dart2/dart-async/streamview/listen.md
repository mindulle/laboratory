Adds a subscription to this stream.

Returns a [StreamSubscription](../streamsubscription-class) which
handles events from this stream using the provided `onData`, `onError`
and `onDone` handlers. The handlers can be changed on the subscription,
but they start out as the provided functions.

On each data event from this stream, the subscriber\'s `onData` handler
is called. If `onData` is `null`, nothing happens.

On errors from this stream, the `onError` handler is called with the
error object and possibly a stack trace.

The `onError` callback must be of type `void Function(Object error)` or
`void Function(Object error, StackTrace)`. The function type determines
whether `onError` is invoked with a stack trace argument. The stack
trace argument may be
[StackTrace.empty](../../dart-core/stacktrace/empty-constant) if this
stream received an error without a stack trace.

Otherwise it is called with just the error object. If `onError` is
omitted, any errors on this stream are considered unhandled, and will be
passed to the current [Zone](../zone-class)\'s error handler. By default
unhandled async errors are treated as if they were uncaught top-level
errors.

If this stream closes and sends a done event, the `onDone` handler is
called. If `onDone` is `null`, nothing happens.

If `cancelOnError` is `true`, the subscription is automatically canceled
when the first error event is delivered. The default is `false`.

While a subscription is paused, or when it has been canceled, the
subscription doesn\'t receive events and none of the event handler
functions are called.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
StreamSubscription<T> listen(void onData(T value)?,
    {Function? onError, void onDone()?, bool? cancelOnError}) {
  return _stream.listen(onData,
      onError: onError, onDone: onDone, cancelOnError: cancelOnError);
}
```
