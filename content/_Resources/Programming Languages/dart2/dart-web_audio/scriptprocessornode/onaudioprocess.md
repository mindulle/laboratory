onAudioProcess property
=======================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[Stream](../../dart-async/stream-class)\<[AudioProcessingEvent](../audioprocessingevent-class)\>
onAudioProcess
:::

Get a Stream that fires events when AudioProcessingEvents occur. This
particular stream is special in that it only allows one listener to a
given stream. Converting the returned
[Stream.asBroadcastStream](../../dart-async/stream/asbroadcaststream)
will likely ruin the soft-real-time properties which which these events
are fired and can be processed.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Stream<AudioProcessingEvent> get onAudioProcess =>
      audioProcessEvent.forTarget(this);
```
