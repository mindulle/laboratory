originalDeclaration property
============================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[TypeMirror](../typemirror-class) originalDeclaration
:::

A mirror on the original declaration of this type.

For most classes, they are their own original declaration. For generic
classes, however, there is a distinction between the original class
declaration, which has unbound type variables, and the instantiations of
generic classes, which have bound type variables.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
TypeMirror get originalDeclaration;
```
