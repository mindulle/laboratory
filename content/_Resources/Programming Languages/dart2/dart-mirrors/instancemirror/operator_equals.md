Whether this mirror is equal to `other`.

The equality holds if and only if

1.  `other` is a mirror of the same kind, and

2.  either

    a\. [hasReflectee](hasreflectee) is true and so is
    `identical(reflectee, other.reflectee)`, or

    b\. the remote objects reflected by this mirror and by `other` are
    identical.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool operator ==(Object other);
```
