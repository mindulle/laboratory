[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) operator ==(

1.  [Object](../../dart-core/object-class) other

)

:::

Whether `other` is an [IsolateMirror](../isolatemirror-class) on the
same isolate as this mirror.

The equality holds if and only if

1.  `other` is a mirror of the same kind, and
2.  the isolate being reflected by this mirror is the same isolate being
    reflected by `other`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool operator ==(Object other);
```
