operator == method

[bool](../../dart-core/bool-class) operator ==(

:::

Whether this mirror is equal to `other`.

The equality holds if and only if

1.  `other` is a mirror of the same kind, and
2.  This mirror and `other` reflect the same class.

Note that if the reflected class is an invocation of a generic class, 2.
implies that the reflected class and `other` have equal type arguments.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
bool operator ==(Object other);
```
