metadata property
=================

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
[List](../../dart-core/list-class)\<[InstanceMirror](../instancemirror-class)\>
metadata
:::

A list of the metadata associated with this declaration.

Let *D* be the declaration this mirror reflects. If *D* is decorated
with annotations *A1, \..., An* where *n \> 0*, then for each annotation
*Ai* associated with *D, 1 \<= i \<= n*, let *ci* be the constant object
specified by *Ai*. Then this method returns a list whose members are
instance mirrors on *c1, \..., cn*. If no annotations are associated
with *D*, then an empty list is returned.

If evaluating any of *c1, \..., cn* would cause a compilation error the
effect is the same as if a non-reflective compilation error had been
encountered.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
List<InstanceMirror> get metadata;
```
