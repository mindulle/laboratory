send method
===========

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void send(

1.  [Object](../../dart-core/object-class)? message

)
:::

Sends an asynchronous `message` through this send port, to its
corresponding [ReceivePort](../receiveport-class).

The transitive object graph of `message` can contain the following
objects:

-   [Null](../../dart-core/null-class)
-   [bool](../../dart-core/bool-class)
-   [int](../../dart-core/int-class)
-   [double](../../dart-core/double-class)
-   [String](../../dart-core/string-class)
-   [List](../../dart-core/list-class) or
    [Map](../../dart-core/map-class) (whose elements are any of these)
-   [TransferableTypedData](../transferabletypeddata-class)
-   [SendPort](../sendport-class)
-   [Capability](../capability-class)

If the sender and receiver isolate share the same code (e.g. isolates
created via [Isolate.spawn](../isolate/spawn)), the transitive object
graph of `message` can contain any object, with the following
exceptions:

-   Objects with native resources (subclasses of e.g.
    `NativeFieldWrapperClass1`). A [Socket](../../dart-io/socket-class)
    object for example referrs internally to objects that have native
    resources attached and can therefore not be sent.
-   [ReceivePort](../receiveport-class)
-   [DynamicLibrary](../../dart-ffi/dynamiclibrary-class)
-   [Finalizable](../../dart-ffi/finalizable-class)
-   [Finalizer](../../dart-core/finalizer-class)
-   [NativeFinalizer](../../dart-ffi/nativefinalizer-class)
-   [Pointer](../../dart-ffi/pointer-class)
-   [UserTag](../../dart-developer/usertag-class)
-   `MirrorReference`

Apart from those exceptions any object can be sent. Objects that are
identified as immutable (e.g. strings) will be shared whereas all other
objects will be copied.

The send happens immediately and may have a linear time cost to copy the
transitive object graph. The send itself doesn\'t block (i.e. doesn\'t
wait until the receiver has received the message). The corresponding
receive port can receive the message as soon as its isolate\'s event
loop is ready to deliver it, independently of what the sending isolate
is doing.

Note: Due to an implementation choice the Dart VM made for how closures
represent captured state, closures can currently capture more state than
they need, which can cause the transitive closure to be larger than
needed. Open bug to address this: <http://dartbug.com/36983>
