dart:isolate library
====================

Concurrent programming using *isolates*: independent workers that are
similar to threads but don\'t share memory, communicating only via
messages.

*NOTE*: The `dart:isolate` library is currently only supported by the
[Dart Native](https://dart.dev/overview#platform) platform.

To use this library in your code:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:isolate';
```
