exit method
===========

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
Never exit(

1.  \[[SendPort](../sendport-class)? finalMessagePort,
2.  [Object](../../dart-core/object-class)? message\]

)
:::

Terminates the current isolate synchronously.

This operation is potentially dangerous and should be used judiciously.
The isolate stops operating *immediately*. It throws if the optional
`message` does not adhere to the limitations on what can be sent from
one isolate to another (see [SendPort.send](../sendport/send) for more
details). It also throws if a `finalMessagePort` is associated with an
isolate spawned outside of current isolate group, spawned via
[spawnUri](spawnuri).

If successful, a call to this method does not return. Pending `finally`
blocks are not executed, control flow will not go back to the event
loop, scheduled asynchronous asks will never run, and even pending
isolate control commands may be ignored. (The isolate will send messages
to ports already registered using
[Isolate.addOnExitListener](addonexitlistener), but no further Dart code
will run in the isolate.)

If `finalMessagePort` is provided, and the `message` can be sent through
it (see [SendPort.send](../sendport/send) for more details), then the
message is sent through that port as the final operation of the current
isolate. The isolate terminates immediately after that
[SendPort.send](../sendport/send) call returns.

If the port is a native port \-- one provided by
[ReceivePort.sendPort](../receiveport/sendport) or
[RawReceivePort.sendPort](../rawreceiveport/sendport) \-- the system may
be able to send this final message more efficiently than normal port
communication between live isolates. In these cases this final message
object graph will be reassigned to the receiving isolate without
copying. Further, the receiving isolate will in most cases be able to
receive the message in constant time.

--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external static Never exit([SendPort? finalMessagePort, Object? message]);
```
