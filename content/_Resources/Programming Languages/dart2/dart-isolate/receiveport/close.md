close method
============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void close()
:::

Closes the receive port.

No further events will be received by the receive port, or emitted as
stream events.

If [listen](listen) has been called and the
[StreamSubscription](../../dart-async/streamsubscription-class) has not
been canceled yet, the subscription will be closed with a \"done\"
event.

If the stream has already been canceled this method has no effect.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void close();
```
