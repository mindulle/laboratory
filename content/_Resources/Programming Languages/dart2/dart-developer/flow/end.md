end method
==========

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[Flow](../flow-class) end(

1.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) id

)
:::

An \"end\" Flow event.

When passed to a [Timeline](../timeline-class) method, generates a
\"end\" Flow event. The `id` argument is required. It can come either
from another [Flow](../flow-class) event, or some id that comes from the
environment.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static Flow end(int id) => new Flow._(_end, id);
```
