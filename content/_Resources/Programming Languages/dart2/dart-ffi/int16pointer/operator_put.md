operator \[\]= method
=====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void operator \[\]=(

1.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) index,
2.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) value

)
:::

The 16-bit two\'s complement integer at `address + 2 * index`.

A Dart integer is truncated to 16 bits (as if by `.toSigned(16)`) before
being stored, and the 16-bit value is sign-extended when it is loaded.

The [address](../pointer/address) must be 2-byte aligned.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external void operator []=(int index, int value);
```
