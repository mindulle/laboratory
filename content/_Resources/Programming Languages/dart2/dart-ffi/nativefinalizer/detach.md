detach method
=============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void detach(

1.  [Object](../../dart-core/object-class) detach

)
:::

Detaches this finalizer from values attached with [detach](detach).

If this finalizer was attached multiple times to the same object with
different detachment keys, only those attachments which used
[detach](detach) are removed.

After detaching, an attachment won\'t cause any callbacks to happen if
the object become inaccessible.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void detach(Object detach);
```
