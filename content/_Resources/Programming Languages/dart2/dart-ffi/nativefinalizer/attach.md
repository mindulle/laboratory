attach method
=============

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void attach(

1.  [Finalizable](../finalizable-class) value,
2.  [Pointer](../pointer-class)\<[Void](../void-class)\> token,
3.  {[Object](../../dart-core/object-class)? detach,
4.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class)? externalSize}

)
:::

Attaches this finalizer to `value`.

When `value` is no longer accessible to the program, the finalizer will
call its callback function with `token` as argument.

If a non-`null` `detach` value is provided, that object can be passed to
[Finalizer.detach](../../dart-core/finalizer/detach) to remove the
attachment again.

The `value` and `detach` arguments do not count towards those objects
being accessible to the program. Both must be objects supported as an
[Expando](../../dart-core/expando-class) key. They may be the *same*
object.

Multiple objects may be using the same finalization token, and the
finalizer can be attached multiple times to the same object with
different, or the same, finalization token.

The callback will be called exactly once per attachment, except for
registrations which have been detached since they were attached.

The `externalSize` should represent the amount of native (non-Dart)
memory owned by the given `value`. This information is used for garbage
collection scheduling heuristics.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
void attach(Finalizable value, Pointer<Void> token,
    {Object? detach, int? externalSize});
```
