ref property
============

::: {#getter .section .multi-line-signature}
T ref
:::

A Dart view of the struct referenced by this pointer.

Reading [ref](ref) creates a reference accessing the fields of this
struct backed by native memory at [address](../pointer/address). The
[address](../pointer/address) must be aligned according to the struct
alignment rules of the platform.

Assigning to [ref](ref) copies contents of the struct into the native
memory starting at [address](../pointer/address).

This extension method must be invoked on a receiver of type `Pointer<T>`
where `T` is a compile-time constant type.

::: {#setter .section .multi-line-signature}
void ref=(T value)
