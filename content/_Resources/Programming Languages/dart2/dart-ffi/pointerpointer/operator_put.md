operator \[\]= method
=====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
void operator \[\]=(

1.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) index,
2.  [Pointer](../pointer-class)\<T\> value

)
:::

Store a Dart value into this location offset by `index`.

A [Pointer](../pointer-class) is unboxed before being stored (as if by
`.address`), and the pointer is boxed (as if by
[Pointer.fromAddress](../pointer/pointer.fromaddress)) when loaded.

On 32-bit platforms the [address](../pointer/address) must be 4-byte
aligned, and on 64-bit platforms the [address](../pointer/address) must
be 8-byte aligned.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external void operator []=(int index, Pointer<T> value);
```
