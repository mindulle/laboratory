operator \[\] method
====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
T operator \[\](

1.  [int](../../dart-core/int-class) index

)
:::

Creates a reference to access the fields of this union backed by native
memory at `address + sizeOf<T>() * index`.

The [address](../pointer/address) must be aligned according to the union
alignment rules of the platform.

This extension method must be invoked on a receiver of type `Pointer<T>`
where `T` is a compile-time constant type.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
external T operator [](int index);
```
