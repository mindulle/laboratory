Dart SDK
========

Welcome to the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) API reference documentation,
covering the [Dart core libraries](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries).
These include:

-   [dart:core](dart-core/dart-core-library): Core functionality such as
    strings, numbers, collections, errors, dates, and URIs.
-   [dart:html](dart-html/dart-html-library): DOM manipulation for web
    apps (available only to web apps).
-   [dart:io](dart-io/dart-io-library): I/O for non-web apps.

Except for `dart:core`, you must import a library before you can use it.
Here\'s an example of importing `dart:async` and `dart:math`:

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:math';
```

You can find more libraries using the [pub.dev site](https://pub.dev).
