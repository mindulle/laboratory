toString method

[String](../../dart-core/string-class) toString()

:::

A string representation of this object.

Some classes have a default textual representation, often paired with a
static `parse` function (like [int.parse](../../dart-core/int/parse)).
These classes will provide the textual representation as their string
representation.

Other classes have no meaningful textual representation that a program
will care about. Such classes will typically override `toString` to
provide useful information when inspecting the object, mainly for
debugging or logging.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
String toString() {
  var safeString = Error.safeToString(unsupportedObject);
  String prefix;
  if (cause != null) {
    prefix = "Converting object to an encodable object failed:";
  } else {
    prefix = "Converting object did not return an encodable object:";
  }
  return "$prefix $safeString";
}
```
