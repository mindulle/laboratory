Transforms the provided `stream`.

Returns a new stream with events that are computed from events of the
provided `stream`.

The [StreamTransformer](../../dart-async/streamtransformer-class)
interface is completely generic, so it cannot say what subclasses do.
Each [StreamTransformer](../../dart-async/streamtransformer-class)
should document clearly how it transforms the stream (on the class or
variable used to access the transformer), as well as any differences
from the following typical behavior:

-   When the returned stream is listened to, it starts listening to the
    input `stream`.
-   Subscriptions of the returned stream forward (in a reasonable time)
    a
    [StreamSubscription.pause](../../dart-async/streamsubscription/pause)
    call to the subscription of the input `stream`.
-   Similarly, canceling a subscription of the returned stream
    eventually (in reasonable time) cancels the subscription of the
    input `stream`.

\"Reasonable time\" depends on the transformer and stream. Some
transformers, like a \"timeout\" transformer, might make these
operations depend on a duration. Others might not delay them at all, or
just by a microtask.

Transformers are free to handle errors in any way. A transformer
implementation may choose to propagate errors, or convert them to other
events, or ignore them completely, but if errors are ignored, it should
be documented explicitly.

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Stream<Object?> bind(Stream<String> stream) => super.bind(stream);
```
