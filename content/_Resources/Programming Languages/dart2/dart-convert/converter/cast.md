:::

Provides a `Converter<RS, RT>` view of this stream transformer.

The resulting transformer will check at run-time that all conversion
inputs are actually instances of `S`, and it will check that all
conversion output produced by this converter are actually instances of
`RT`.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
Converter<RS, RT> cast<RS, RT>() => Converter.castFrom<S, T, RS, RT>(this);
```
