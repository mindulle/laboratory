successEvent constant
=====================

::: {.section .multi-line-signature}
[EventStreamProvider](../../dart-html/eventstreamprovider-class)\<[Event](../../dart-html/event-class)\>
const successEvent
:::

Static factory designed to expose `success` events to event handlers
that are not necessarily instances of [Request](../request-class).

See [EventStreamProvider](../../dart-html/eventstreamprovider-class) for
usage information.

Implementation {#source}
--------------

``` {.language-dart data-language="dart"}
static const EventStreamProvider<Event> successEvent =
    const EventStreamProvider<Event>('success');
```
