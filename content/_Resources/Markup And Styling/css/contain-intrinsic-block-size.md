contain-intrinsic-block-size
============================

The `contain-intrinsic-block-size`
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [](css_logical_properties_and_values.md) defines the block size of
an element that a browser can use for layout when the element is subject
to [size containment](css_containment.md#size_containment).

Block size is the size of an element in the dimension perpendicular to
the flow of text within a line. In a horizontal [](writing-mode.md) like standard English, block size is the vertical
dimension (height); in a vertical writing mode, block size is the
horizontal dimension.

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
/* Keyword values */
contain-intrinsic-block-size: none;

/* <length> values */
contain-intrinsic-block-size: 1000px;
contain-intrinsic-block-size: 10rem;

/* auto <length> */
contain-intrinsic-block-size: auto 300px;

/* Global values */
contain-intrinsic-block-size: inherit;
contain-intrinsic-block-size: initial;
contain-intrinsic-block-size: revert;
contain-intrinsic-block-size: revert-layer;
contain-intrinsic-block-size: unset;
```

### Values

The following values can be specified for the intrinsic block size of an
element:

[`none`](#none)

:   The element has no intrinsic block size.

[`<length>`](#length)

:   The element has the specified block size, expressed using the
    ([`<length>`](length.md)) data type.

[`auto <length>`](#auto_length)

:   When the element is in size containment and skipping its contents
    (for example, when it is offscreen and `content-visibility: auto` is
    set) the block size is remembered from the actual size of the
    element when it was last able to render its child elements. If the
    element has never rendered its child elements and hence has no
    remembered value for the normally rendered element size, or if it is
    not skipping its contents, the block size is the specified
    `<length>`.

Description
-----------

The property is commonly applied alongside elements that can trigger
size containment, such as [`contain: size`](contain.md) and
[`content-visibility`](content-visibility.md).

Size containment allows a user agent to lay out an element as though it
had a fixed size. This prevents unnecessary reflows by avoiding the
re-rendering of child elements to determine the actual size (thereby
improving user experience). By default, size containment treats elements
as though they had no contents and may collapse the layout in the same
way as if the contents had no width or height. The
`contain-intrinsic-block-size` property allows authors to specify an
appropriate value to be used as the block-size for layout.

The `auto <length>` value allows the block-size of an element to be
stored if the element is ever \"normally rendered\" (with its child
elements) and then used instead of the specified value when the element
does not have any content. This allows offscreen elements with
[`content-visibility: auto`](content-visibility.md) to benefit from size
containment without developers having to be precise in their estimates
of element size. The remembered value is not used if the child elements
are being rendered; if size containment is enabled, the `<length>` value
will be used.

Formal definition
-----------------

  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  [Initial value](initial_value.md)     `none`
  Applies to                         elements for which size containment can apply
  [Inherited](inheritance.md)           no
  [Computed value](computed_value.md)   as specified, with \<length\>s values computed
  Animation type                     by computed value type
  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

Formal syntax
-------------

```
contain-intrinsic-block-size = 
  none           |
  <length>       |
  auto <length>  
```

Examples
--------

### Setting the intrinsic block size

The HTML below defines an element \"contained\_element\" that will be
subject to size constraint, and which contains a child element.

[html]

```html
<div id="contained_element">
  <div class="child_element"></div>
</div>
```

The CSS below sets the [`content-visibility`](content-visibility.md) of
`contained_element` to `auto`, so if the element is hidden it will be
size constrained. The intrinsic block size and inline size that are used
when it is size constrained are set at the same time using
`contain-intrinsic-block-size` and `contain-intrinsic-inline-size`,
respectively.

[css]

```css
#contained_element {
  border: 2px solid green;
  inline-size: 151px;
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-inline-size: 152px;
  contain-intrinsic-block-size: 52px;
}
.child_element {
  border: 1px solid red;
  background: blue;
  block-size: 50px;
  inline-size: 150px;
}
```
