The `scroll-timeline`
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [](shorthand_properties.md) is used to define a *named scroll
progress timeline*, which is progressed through by scrolling a
scrollable element (*scroller*) between top and bottom (or left and
right). `scroll-timeline` is set on the scroller that will provide the
timeline. The starting scroll position represents 0% progress and the
ending scroll position represents 100% progress. If the 0% position and
100% position coincide (i.e., the scroll container has no overflow to
scroll), the timeline is inactive.

`scroll-timeline` can contain two constituent values --- a name for the
named scroll progress timeline, and an optional scroll axis value.

The name is then referenced in an
[`animation-timeline`](animation-timeline.md) declaration to indicate the
container\'s element that is used to drive the progress of the animation
through the scrolling action.

**Note:** If the scroller does not overflow its container in the axis
dimension or if the overflow is hidden or clipped, no timeline will be
created.

Constituent properties
----------------------

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`scroll-timeline-name`](scroll-timeline-name.md)
- [`scroll-timeline-axis`](scroll-timeline-axis.md)

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
/* two values: one each for scroll-timeline-name and scroll-timeline-axis */
scroll-timeline: --custom_name_for_timeline block;
scroll-timeline: --custom_name_for_timeline inline;
scroll-timeline: --custom_name_for_timeline y;
scroll-timeline: --custom_name_for_timeline x;
scroll-timeline: none block;
scroll-timeline: none inline;
scroll-timeline: none y;
scroll-timeline: none x;

/* one value: scroll-timeline-name */
scroll-timeline: none;
scroll-timeline: --custom_name_for_timeline;
```

The `scroll-timeline` shorthand property can be applied to a container
element as a combination of the `<scroll-timeline-name>` and
`<scroll-timeline-axis>` values. At least one of the values must be
specified. If both the values are specified, the order followed must be
the `<scroll-timeline-name>` value followed by the
`<scroll-timeline-axis>` value.

**Note:** `<scroll-timeline-name>`s must be
[`<dashed-ident>`](dashed-ident.md) values, which means they must start
with `--`. This helps avoid name clashes with standard CSS keywords.

### Values

[`<scroll-timeline-name>`](#scroll-timeline-name)

:   See [`scroll-timeline-name`](scroll-timeline-name.md).

[`<scroll-timeline-axis>`](#scroll-timeline-axis)

:   See [`scroll-timeline-axis`](scroll-timeline-axis.md). The default
    value is `block`.

Formal syntax

```

Examples
--------

### Creating a named scroll progress timeline animation

In this example, a scroll timeline named `--squareTimeline` is defined
using the `scroll-timeline-name` property on the element with the ID
`container`. This is then applied to the animation on the `#square`
element using `animation-timeline: --squareTimeline`.

#### HTML

The HTML for the example is shown below.

[html]

```html
<div id="container">
  <div id="square"></div>
  <div id="stretcher"></div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

The CSS for the container sets it as the source of a scroll timeline
named `--squareTimeline` using the `scroll-timeline` property. It also
sets the scrollbar to use for the timeline as the vertical scrollbar
(this is not actually needed as it is the default).

The height of the container is set to `300px`, and the container is also
set to create a vertical scrollbar if it overflows (the CSS `height`
rule on the `stretcher` element below does make the content overflow its
container).

[css]

```css
#container {
  height: 300px;
  overflow-y: scroll;
  scroll-timeline: --squareTimeline y;
  /* Firefox supports the older "vertical" syntax */
  scroll-timeline: --squareTimeline vertical;
  position: relative;
}
```

The CSS below defines a square that rotates according to the timeline
provided by the `animation-timeline` property, which is set to the
`--squareTimeline` timeline named above.

[css]

```css
#square {
  background-color: deeppink;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  animation-name: rotateAnimation;
  animation-duration: 1ms; /* Firefox requires this to apply the animation */
  animation-timeline: --squareTimeline;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
}

#stretcher {
  height: 600px;
  background: #dedede;
}

@keyframes rotateAnimation {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }

  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```

The `stretcher` CSS rule sets the block height to `600px`, which creates
content that overflows the container element, thereby creating scroll
bars. Without this element, the content would not overflow the
container, there would be no scrollbar, and hence no scroll timeline to
associate with the animation timeline.

#### Result

Scroll the vertical bar to see the square animate as you scroll.

The square animates as you scroll, and the animation duration when using
`scroll-timeline` depends on the scroll speed (nevertheless, the
`animation-duration` property has been defined so you can make out the
scroll-driven animation).
