:in-range
=========

The `:in-range` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[pseudo-class](pseudo-classes.md) represents an
[`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)
element whose current value is within the range limits specified by the
[`min`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#min)
and
[`max`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#max)
attributes.

Try it
------

This pseudo-class is useful for giving the user a visual indication that
a field\'s current value is within the permitted limits.

**Note:** This pseudo-class only applies to elements that have (and can
take) a range limitation. In the absence of such a limitation, the
element can neither be \"in-range\" nor \"out-of-range.\"

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
:in-range {
  /* ... */
}
```

Examples
--------

### HTML

[html]

```html
<form action="" id="form1">
  <ul>
    Values between 1 and 10 are valid.
    <li>
      <input
        id="value1"
        name="value1"
        type="number"
        placeholder="1 to 10"
        min="1"
        max="10"
        value="12"
        required />
      <label for="value1">Your value is </label>
    </li>
  </ul>
</form>
```

### CSS

[css]

```css
li {
  list-style: none;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}

input {
  border: 1px solid black;
}

input:in-range {
  background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25);
}

input:out-of-range {
  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.25);
  border: 2px solid red;
}

input:in-range + label::after {
  content: "okay.";
}

input:out-of-range + label::after {
  content: "out of range!";
}
```

### Result

**Note:** An empty `<input>` does not count as out of range, and will
not be selected using the `:out-of-range` pseudo-class selector. The
[`:blank`](:blank) pseudo-class exists to select blank inputs, although
at the time of writing this is experimental and not well-supported. You
could also use the `required` attribute and the [`:invalid`](:invalid)
pseudo-class to provide more general logic and styling for making inputs
mandatory (`:invalid` will style blank *and* out-of-range inputs).
