CSS shapes
==========

The **CSS shapes** module describes geometric shapes that can be in CSS.
For the [Level 1 specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shapes/),
CSS shapes can be applied to floating elements. The specification
defines a number of different ways to define a shape on a floated
element, causing wrapping lines to wrap round the shape rather than
following the rectangle of the element\'s box.

Basic example
-------------

The example below shows an image that has been floated left, and the
`shape-outside` property applied with a value of `circle(50%)`. This
creates a circle shape, and the content wrapping the float now wraps
around that shape. This changes the length of the wrapping text\'s line
boxes.
