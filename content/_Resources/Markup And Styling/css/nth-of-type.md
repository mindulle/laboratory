:nth-of-type()
==============

The `:nth-of-type()`
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[pseudo-class](pseudo-classes.md) matches elements based on their position
among siblings of the same type (tag name).

Try it
------

Syntax
------

The `nth-of-type` pseudo-class is specified with a single argument,
which represents the pattern for matching elements.

See [`:nth-child`](:nth-child) for a more detailed explanation of its
syntax.

[css]

```css
:nth-of-type(<an-plus-b> | even | odd) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Examples
--------

### Basic example

#### HTML

[html]

```html
<div>
  <div>This element isn't counted.</div>
  <p>1st paragraph.</p>
  <p class="fancy">2nd paragraph.</p>
  <div>This element isn't counted.</div>
  <p class="fancy">3rd paragraph.</p>
  <p>4th paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

#### CSS

[css]

```css
/* Odd paragraphs */
p:nth-of-type(2n + 1) {
  color: red;
}

/* Even paragraphs */
p:nth-of-type(2n) {
  color: blue;
}

/* First paragraph */
p:nth-of-type(1) {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* This will match the 3rd paragraph as it will match elements which are 2n+1 AND have a class of fancy.
The second paragraph has a class of fancy but is not matched as it is not :nth-of-type(2n+1) */
p.fancy:nth-of-type(2n + 1) {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### Result

**Note:** There is no way to select the nth-of-class using this
selector. The selector looks at the type only when creating the list of
matches. You can however apply CSS to an element based on `:nth-of-type`
location **and** a class, as shown in the example above.
