dynamic-range
=============

The `dynamic-range`
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [](@media.md#media_features) can be used to test the combination
of brightness, contrast ratio, and color depth that are supported by the
[user
agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) and
the output device.

**Note:** Some devices have high dynamic range capabilities that are not
always \'on\' and need to be activated (sometimes programmatically,
sometimes by the user, sometimes based on the content). This media
feature does not test whether the dynamic range capability is active; it
only tests whether the device is capable of high dynamic range visuals.

Syntax
------

The `dynamic-range` feature is specified as a keyword value chosen from
the list below.

[`standard`](#standard)

:   This value matches any visual device and excludes devices lacking
    visual capabilities. A user agent or an output device that matches
    `high` will also match the `standard` value.

[`high`](#high)

:   This value matches user agents and output devices that support high
    peak brightness, high contrast ratio, and color depth greater than
    24 bit or 8 bit per color component of RGB. **Peak brightness**
    refers to how bright the brightest point a light-emitting device,
    such as an LCD screen, can produce. In the case of a
    light-reflective device, such as paper or e-ink, peak brightness
    refers to the point that at least absorbs light. **Contrast ratio**
    refers to the ratio of the luminance of the brightest color to that
    of the darkest color that the system is capable of producing.
    Currently, there is no precise way to measure peak brightness and
    contrast ratio, and the determination of what counts as high peak
    brightness and high contrast ratio depends on the user agent.

Examples
--------

[css]

```css
@media (dynamic-range: standard) {
  p {
    color: red;
  }
}

@media (dynamic-range: high) {
  p {
    color: green;
  }
}
```
