pointer-events
==============

The `pointer-events`
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets
under what circumstances (if any) a particular graphic element can
become the
[target](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target)
of pointer events.

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
/* Keyword values */
pointer-events: auto;
pointer-events: none;
pointer-events: visiblePainted; /* SVG only */
pointer-events: visibleFill; /* SVG only */
pointer-events: visibleStroke; /* SVG only */
pointer-events: visible; /* SVG only */
pointer-events: painted; /* SVG only */
pointer-events: fill; /* SVG only */
pointer-events: stroke; /* SVG only */
pointer-events: all; /* SVG only */

/* Global values */
pointer-events: inherit;
pointer-events: initial;
pointer-events: revert;
pointer-events: revert-layer;
pointer-events: unset;
```

The `pointer-events` property is specified as a single keyword chosen
from the list of values below.

### Values

[`auto`](#auto)

:   The element behaves as it would if the `pointer-events` property
    were not specified. In SVG content, this value and the value
    `visiblePainted` have the same effect.

[`none`](#none)

:   The element is never the
    [target](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target)
    of pointer events; however, pointer events may target its descendant
    elements if those descendants have `pointer-events` set to some
    other value. In these circumstances, pointer events will trigger
    event listeners on this parent element as appropriate on their way
    to/from the descendant during the event
    capture/[bubble](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/bubbles)
    phases.

#### SVG only (experimental for HTML)

[`visiblePainted`](#visiblepainted)

:   SVG only (experimental for HTML). The element can only be the target
    of a pointer event when the `visibility` property is set to
    `visible` and e.g. when a mouse cursor is over the interior (i.e.,
    \'fill\') of the element and the `fill` property is set to a value
    other than `none`, or when a mouse cursor is over the perimeter
    (i.e., \'stroke\') of the element and the `stroke` property is set
    to a value other than `none`.

[`visibleFill`](#visiblefill)

:   SVG only. The element can only be the target of a pointer event when
    the `visibility` property is set to `visible` and when e.g. a mouse
    cursor is over the interior (i.e., fill) of the element. The value
    of the `fill` property does not affect event processing.

[`visibleStroke`](#visiblestroke)

:   SVG only. The element can only be the target of a pointer event when
    the `visibility` property is set to `visible` and e.g. when the
    mouse cursor is over the perimeter (i.e., stroke) of the element.
    The value of the `stroke` property does not affect event processing.

[`visible`](#visible)

:   SVG only (experimental for HTML). The element can be the target of a
    pointer event when the `visibility` property is set to `visible` and
    e.g. the mouse cursor is over either the interior (i.e., fill) or
    the perimeter (i.e., stroke) of the element. The values of the
    `fill` and `stroke` do not affect event processing.

[`painted`](#painted)

:   SVG only (experimental for HTML). The element can only be the target
    of a pointer event when e.g. the mouse cursor is over the interior
    (i.e., \'fill\') of the element and the `fill` property is set to a
    value other than `none`, or when the mouse cursor is over the
    perimeter (i.e., \'stroke\') of the element and the `stroke`
    property is set to a value other than `none`. The value of the
    `visibility` property does not affect event processing.

[`fill`](#fill)

:   SVG only. The element can only be the target of a pointer event when
    the pointer is over the interior (i.e., fill) of the element. The
    values of the `fill` and `visibility` properties do not affect event
    processing.

[`stroke`](#stroke)

:   SVG only. The element can only be the target of a pointer event when
    the pointer is over the perimeter (i.e., stroke) of the element. The
    values of the `stroke` and `visibility` properties do not affect
    event processing.

[`all`](#all)

:   SVG only (experimental for HTML). The element can only be the target
    of a pointer event when the pointer is over the interior (i.e.,
    fill) or the perimeter (i.e., stroke) of the element. The values of
    the `fill`, `stroke`, and `visibility` properties do not affect
    event processing.

Description
-----------

When this property is unspecified, the same characteristics of the
`visiblePainted` value apply to SVG content.

In addition to indicating that the element is not the target of pointer
events, the value `none` instructs the pointer event to go \"through\"
the element and target whatever is \"underneath\" that element instead.

Note that preventing an element from being the target of pointer events
by using `pointer-events` does *not* necessarily mean that pointer event
listeners on that element *cannot* or *will not* be triggered. If one of
the element\'s children has `pointer-events` explicitly set to *allow*
that child to be the target of pointer events, then any events targeting
that child will pass through the parent as the event travels along the
parent chain, and trigger event listeners on the parent as appropriate.
Of course any pointer activity at a point on the screen that is covered
by the parent but not by the child will not be caught by either the
child or the parent (it will go \"through\" the parent and target
whatever is underneath).

Elements with `pointer-events: none` will still receive focus through
sequential keyboard navigation using the [Tab] key.

Examples
--------

### Disabling pointer events on all images

This example disables pointer events (clicking, dragging, hovering,
etc.) on all images.

[css]

```css
img {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

### Disabling pointer events on a single link

This example disables pointer events on the link to
`http://example.com`.

#### HTML

[html]

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://example.com">example.com</a></li>
</ul>
```

#### CSS

[css]

```css
a[href="http://example.com"]
{
  pointer-events: none;
}
```
