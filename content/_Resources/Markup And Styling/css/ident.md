\<ident\>
=========

The `<ident>` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[data type](css_types.md) denotes an arbitrary string used as an
[identifier](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier).

Syntax
------

The syntax of `<custom-ident>` is similar to CSS identifiers (such as
property names), except that it is
[case-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity). It
consists of one or more characters, where characters can be any of the
following:

- any alphabetical character (`A` to `Z`, or `a` to `z`),
- any decimal digit (`0` to `9`),
- a hyphen (`-`),
- an underscore (`_`),
- an escaped character (preceded by a backslash, `\`),
- a [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) character (in the
    format of a backslash, `\`, followed by one to six hexadecimal
    digits, representing its Unicode code point)

Note that `id1`, `Id1`, `iD1` and `ID1` are all different identifiers as
they are
[case-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity). On the
other hand, as there are several ways to escape a character, `toto\?`
and `toto\3F` are the same identifiers.

Examples
--------

### Valid identifiers

```
nono79        A mix of alphanumeric characters and numbers
ground-level  A mix of alphanumeric characters and a dash
-test         A dash followed by alphanumeric characters
--toto        A custom-property like identifier
_internal     An underscore followed by alphanumeric characters
\22 toto      A Unicode character followed by a sequence of alphanumeric characters
bili\.bob     A correctly escaped period
```

### Invalid identifiers

```
34rem     It must not start with a decimal digit.
-12rad    It must not start with a dash followed by a decimal digit.
bili.bob  Only alphanumeric characters, _, and - needn't be escaped.
'bilibob' This would be a <string>.
"bilibob" This would be a <string>.
```
