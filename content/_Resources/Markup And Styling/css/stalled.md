:stalled
========

The `:stalled` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[pseudo-class](pseudo-classes.md) selector represents an element that is
playable, such as
[`<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio)
or
[`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video),
when playback is stalled. A resource is considered to be stalled if the
user has requested playback of a specific position in the media
resource, but it has failed to receive any data for some amount of time.
This is different from [`:buffering`](:buffering) in that the media
element is unexpectedly not loading data when stalled (e.g. due to a
network error) for around 3 seconds (the exact time is [user agent
dependent](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#stall-timeout)).

**Note:** Like with the [`:buffering`](:buffering) pseudo-class, the
element is still considered to be \"playing\" when it is \"stalled\". If
`:stalled` matches an element, [`:playing`](:playing) will also match
that element.
