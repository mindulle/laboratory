::after
=======

In CSS, `::after` creates a [pseudo-element](pseudo-elements.md) that is
the last child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic
content to an element with the [`content`](content.md) property. It is
inline by default.

Try it
------

**Note:** The pseudo-elements generated by `::before` and `::after` are
[contained by the element\'s formatting
box](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#before-after-content), and
thus don\'t apply to *[replaced elements](replaced_element.md)* such as
[`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img),
or to
[`<br>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br)
elements.

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
::after {
  content: /* value */;
  /* properties */
}
```

If the [`content`](content.md) property is not specified, has an invalid
value, or has `normal` or `none` as a value, then the `::after`
pseudo-element is not rendered. It behaves as if `display: none` is set.

**Note:** CSS introduced the `::after` notation (with two colons) to
distinguish [pseudo-classes](pseudo-classes.md) from
[pseudo-elements](pseudo-elements.md). For backward compatibility, browsers
also accept `:after`, introduced earlier.

Examples
--------

### Simple usage

Let\'s create two classes: one for boring paragraphs and one for
exciting ones. We can use these classes to add pseudo-elements to the
end of paragraphs.

#### HTML

[html]

```html
<p class="boring-text">Here is some plain old boring text.</p>
<p>Here is some normal text that is neither boring nor exciting.</p>
<p class="exciting-text">Contributing to MDN is easy and fun.</p>
```

#### CSS

[css]

```css
.exciting-text::after {
  content: " <- EXCITING!";
  color: green;
}

.boring-text::after {
  content: " <- BORING";
  color: red;
}
```

#### Result

### Decorative example

We can style text or images in the [`content`](content.md) property almost
any way we want.

#### HTML

[html]

```html
<span class="ribbon">Look at the orange box after this text. </span>
```

#### CSS

[css]

```css
.ribbon {
  background-color: #5bc8f7;
}

.ribbon::after {
  content: "This is a fancy orange box.";
  background-color: #ffba10;
  border-color: black;
  border-style: dotted;
}
```

#### Result

### Tooltips

This example uses `::after`, in conjunction with the [`attr()`](attr.md)
CSS expression and a `data-descr` [custom data
attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*),
to create tooltips. No JavaScript is required!

We can also support keyboard users with this technique, by adding a
`tabindex` of `0` to make each `span` keyboard focusable, and using a
CSS `:focus` selector. This shows how flexible `::before` and `::after`
can be, though for the most accessible experience a semantic disclosure
widget created in some other way (such as with [details and
summary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
elements) is likely to be more appropriate.

#### HTML

[html]

```html
<p>
  Here we have some
  <span tabindex="0" data-descr="collection of words and punctuation">
    text
  </span>
  with a few
  <span tabindex="0" data-descr="small popups that appear when hovering">
    tooltips</span
  >.
</p>
```

#### CSS

[css]

```css
span[data-descr] {
  position: relative;
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: #00f;
  cursor: help;
}

span[data-descr]:hover::after,
span[data-descr]:focus::after {
  content: attr(data-descr);
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 24px;
  min-width: 200px;
  border: 1px #aaaaaa solid;
  border-radius: 10px;
  background-color: #ffffcc;
  padding: 12px;
  color: #000000;
  font-size: 14px;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

#### Result

Accessibility concerns
----------------------

Using an `::after` pseudo-element to add content is discouraged, as it
is not reliably accessible to screen readers.
