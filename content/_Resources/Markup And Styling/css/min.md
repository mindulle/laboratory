min()
=====

The `min()` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[function](css_functions.md) lets you set the smallest (most negative)
value from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of a CSS
property value. The `min()` function can be used anywhere a
[`<length>`](length.md), [`<frequency>`](frequency.md), [`<angle>`](angle.md),
[`<time>`](time.md), [`<percentage>`](percentage.md), [`<number>`](number.md), or
[`<integer>`](integer.md) is allowed.

Try it
------

In the first above example, the width will be at most 200px, but will be
smaller if the viewport is less than 400px wide (in which case 1vw would
be 4px, so 50vw would be 200px). This technique uses an absolute unit to
specify a fixed maximum value for the property, and a relative unit to
allow the value to shrink to suit smaller viewports.

Syntax
------

The `min()` function takes one or more comma-separated expressions as
its parameter, with the smallest (most negative) expression value result
used as the value.

The expressions can be math expressions (using arithmetic operators),
literal values, or other expressions, such as [`attr()`](attr.md), that
evaluate to a valid argument type (like [`<length>`](length.md)).

You can use different units for each value in your expression, if you
wish. You may also use parentheses to establish computation order when
needed.

### Notes

- Math expressions involving percentages for widths and heights on
    table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups,
    and table cells in both auto and fixed layout tables *may* be
    treated as if `auto` had been specified.
- It is permitted to nest `max()` and other `min()` functions as
    expression values. The expressions are full math expressions, so you
    can use direct addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
    without using the `calc()` function itself.
- The expression can be values combining the addition ( + ),
    subtraction ( - ), multiplication ( \* ) and division ( / )
    operators, using standard operator precedence rules. Make sure to
    put a space on each side of the + and - operands. The operands in
    the expression may be any `<length>` syntax value.
- You can (and often need to) combine `min()` and `max()` values, or
    use `min()` within a `clamp()` or `calc()` function.
- You can provide more than two arguments, if you have multiple
    constraints to apply.

### Formal syntax

```
<min()> = 
  min( <calc-sum># )  

<calc-sum> = 
  <calc-product> [ [ '+' | '-' ] <calc-product> ]*  

<calc-product> = 
  <calc-value> [ [ '*' | '/' ] <calc-value> ]*  

<calc-value> = 
  <number>         |
  <dimension>      |
  <percentage>     |
  <calc-constant>  |
  ( <calc-sum> )   

<calc-constant> = 
  e          |
  pi         |
  infinity   |
  -infinity  |
  NaN        
```

Accessibility concerns
----------------------

When using `min()` to set a maximum font size, ensure that the font can
still be scaled at least 200% for readability (without assistive
technology like a zoom function).

Examples
--------

### Setting a maximum size for a label and input

Another use case for `min()` is to set a maximum size on responsive form
controls: enabling the width of labels and inputs to shrink as the width
of the form shrinks.

Let\'s look at some CSS:

[css]

```css
input,
label {
  padding: 2px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  width: min(40%, 400px);
  background-color: pink;
}

form {
  margin: 4px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 4px;
}
```

Here, the form itself, along with the margin, border, and padding, will
be 100% of its parent\'s width. We declare the input and label to be the
lesser of 40% of the form width up to the padding or 400px wide,
whichever is smaller. In other words, the widest that the label and
input can be is 400px. The narrowest they will be is 40% of the form\'s
width, which on a smartwatch\'s screen is very small.

[html]

```html
<form>
  <label for="misc">Type something:</label>
  <input type="text" id="misc" name="misc" />
</form>
```
