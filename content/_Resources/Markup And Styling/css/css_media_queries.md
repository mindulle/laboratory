CSS media queries
=================

**CSS media queries** are a key component of [responsive
design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)
that allow you to apply CSS styles depending on the presence or value of
device characteristics.

It\'s common to apply a media query based on the
[viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport)
size so that layout choices can be made for devices with different
screen sizes. For example, you may have a smaller font size for devices
with small screens, increase the padding between paragraphs when a page
is viewed in portrait mode, or increase the size of buttons on
touchscreens.

In [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), use the
[`@media`](@media.md) [at-rule](at-rule.md) to conditionally apply part of a
style sheet based on the result of a media query. To conditionally apply
an entire style sheet, use [`@import`](@import.md).

When designing reusable HTML components, you may also use [](css_container_queries.md), which allow you to apply styles based
on the size of a containing element rather than the viewport or other
device characteristics.

### Media queries in HTML

In [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), media
queries can be applied to various elements:

- In the
    [`<link>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)
    element\'s
    [`media`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#media)
    attribute, they define the media to which a linked resource
    (typically CSS) should be applied.
- In the
    [`<source>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source)
    element\'s
    [`media`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#media)
    attribute, they define the media to which that source should be
    applied. (This is only valid inside
    [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture)
    elements.)
- In the
    [`<style>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)
    element\'s
    [`media`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style#media)
    attribute, they define the media to which the style should be
    applied.

### Media queries in JavaScript

In
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript),
you can use the
[`Window.matchMedia()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
method to test the window against a media query. You can also use
[`MediaQueryList.addListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaQueryList/addListener)
to be notified whenever the state of a query changes. With this
functionality, your site or app can respond to changes in the device
configuration, orientation, or state.

You can learn more about programmatically using media queries in
[Testing media queries](testing_media_queries.md).
