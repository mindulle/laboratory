\@color-profile
===============

The `@color-profile`
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[at-rule](at-rule.md) defines and names a color profile which can later be
used in the [`color()`](_Resources/Markup%20And%20Styling/css/color_value/color.md) function to specify a color.

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
@color-profile --swop5c {
  src: url("https://example.org/SWOP2006_Coated5v2.icc");
}
```

### Descriptors

[`src`](#src)

:   Specifies the URL to retrieve the color-profile information from.

[`rendering-intent`](#rendering-intent)

:   If the color profile contains more than one rendering intent, this
    descriptor allows one to be selected as the one to use to define how
    to map the color to smaller
    [gamut](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Gamut)s
    than this profile is defined over.

    If used, it must be one of the following keywords:

    [`relative-colorimetric`](#relative-colorimetric)

    :   Media-relative colorimetric is required to leave source colors
        that fall inside the destination medium
        [gamut](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Gamut)
        unchanged relative to the respective media white points. Source
        colors that are out of the destination medium gamut are mapped
        to colors on the gamut boundary using a variety of different
        methods.

    [`absolute-colorimetric`](#absolute-colorimetric)

    :   ICC-absolute colorimetric is required to leave source colors
        that fall inside the destination medium
        [gamut](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Gamut)
        unchanged relative to the adopted white (a perfect reflecting
        diffuser). Source colors that are out of the destination medium
        gamut are mapped to colors on the gamut boundary using a variety
        of different methods.

    [`perceptual`](#perceptual)

    :   This method is often the preferred choice for images, especially
        when there are substantial differences between the source and
        destination (such as a screen display image reproduced on a
        reflection print). It takes the colors of the source image and
        re-optimizes the appearance for the destination medium using
        proprietary methods.

    [`saturation`](#saturation)

    :   This option was created to preserve the relative saturation
        (chroma) of the original, and to keep solid colors pure.
        However, it experienced interoperability problems like the
        perceptual intent.

Examples
--------

This example is from the specification and demonstrates using offset
printing to ISO 12647-2:2004 using the CGATS/SWOP TR005 2007
characterization data on grade 5 paper with an ink limit of 300% Total
Area Coverage, and medium gray component replacement (GCR).

The `src` descriptor specifies the URL to retrieve the color-profile
information from.

[css]

```css
@color-profile --swop5c {
  src: url("https://example.org/SWOP2006_Coated5v2.icc");
}
.header {
  background-color: color(--swop5c 0% 70% 20% 0%);
}
```

Formal syntax
-------------

```
@color-profile = 
  @color-profile [ <dashed-ident> | device-cmyk ]   
```
