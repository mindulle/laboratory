Color picker tool
=================

This tool makes it easy to create, adjust, and experiment with custom
colors for the web. It also makes it easy to convert between various
[color formats](color_value.md) supported by
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), including: HEXA
colors, RGB (Red/Green/Blue) and HSL (Hue/Saturation/Lightness). Control
over the alpha channel is also supported.

As you adjust the parameters that define the color, it gets displayed in
all three standard Web CSS formats. In addition, based on the
currently-selected color, a palette for HSL and HSV, as well as alpha,
is generated. The \"eyedropper\" style color picker box can be toggled
between HSL or HSV format. You can also test colors and how they overlap
one another by dragging them into the box at the bottom of the tool and
moving them over one another. Adjust their relative Z index values to
move them forward and behind one another.

This tool will help you identify the perfect CSS colors to apply to your
[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).

The generated colors you create above can be used anywhere color is used
in CSS and HTML, unless otherwise noted.
