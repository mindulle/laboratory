counter-reset
=============

The `counter-reset`
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property resets
a [CSS counter](using_css_counters.md) to a given value.
This property will create a new counter or reversed counter with the
given name on the specified element.

Normal counters have a default initial value of 0. Reversed counters are
intended to count down, and have a default initial value set to the
number of elements at the current level. The default initial values make
it easy to implement the two most common numbering patterns: counting up
from one to the number of elements, and counting down from the number of
elements to one.

A counter\'s value is increased or decreased using the
[`counter-increment`](counter-increment.md) CSS property, and the value of
an existing counter may be set using [`counter-set`](counter-set.md).

Try it
------

In addition to author-created counters, the property can also reset the
`list-item` counters used by ordered lists (as created using
[`<ol>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol)
elements). These have the same behavior as author-created counters,
except they are *automatically* incremented/decremented by one with each
list element. This behavior can be overridden using
[`counter-increment`](counter-increment.md).

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
/* Set "my-counter" to 0 */
counter-reset: my-counter;

/* Set "my-counter" to -3 */
counter-reset: my-counter -3;

/* Set reversed "my-counter" to "the number of peer elements" */
counter-reset: reversed(my-counter);

/* Set reversed "my-counter" to -1 */
counter-reset: reversed(my-counter) -1;

/* Set counter2 to 9 and reversed "counter1" and "counter3" to 1 and 4, respectively*/
counter-reset: reversed(counter1) 1 counter2 9 reversed(counter3) 4;

/* Cancel any reset that could have been set in less specific rules */
counter-reset: none;

/* Global values */
counter-reset: inherit;
counter-reset: initial;
counter-reset: revert;
counter-reset: revert-layer;
counter-reset: unset;
```

The `counter-reset` property is specified as either one of the
following:

- A `<custom-ident>` or a `reversed(<custom-ident>)` naming the
    counter, followed optionally by an `<integer>`. Note that the
    `reversed()` method is used to create a \"reversed\" counter. You
    may specify as many counters and reversed counters to reset as you
    want, with each counter or counter-number pair separated by a space.
- The keyword value `none`.

The \"implicit\" counter named `list-item` can be used to control the
numbering for ordered lists, as created using
[`<ol>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol)

### Values

[`<custom-ident>`](custom-ident.md)

:   The name of the counter to reset.

[`<integer>`](integer.md)

:   The value to reset the counter to on each occurrence of the element.
    Defaults to `0` if not specified.

[`none`](#none)

:   No counter reset is to be performed. This can be used to override a
    `counter-reset` defined in a less specific rule.

Formal definition
-----------------

  ---------------------------------- ------------------------
  [Initial value](initial_value.md)     `none`
  Applies to                         all elements
  [Inherited](inheritance.md)           no
  [Computed value](computed_value.md)   as specified
  Animation type                     by computed value type
  ---------------------------------- ------------------------

Formal syntax
-------------

```
counter-reset = 
  [ <counter-name> <integer>? | <reversed-counter-name> <integer>? ]+  |
  none                                                

<reversed-counter-name> = 
  reversed( <counter-name> )  
```

Examples
--------

The following examples show how to reset the counters, but not how they
are incremented, decremented, and displayed.

For more-complete examples see [](using_css_counters.md).

### Resetting named counters

[css]

```css
h1 {
  counter-reset: chapter section 1 page;
  /* Sets the chapter and page counters to 0,
     and the section counter to 1 */
}
```

### Reversing a counter

[css]

```css
h1 {
  counter-reset: reversed(chapter) reversed(section) 1 page;
  /* Sets the reversed flag on the chapter and section counters.
     Sets the chapter to the number of elements, the section counter to 1,
     and the page counters to 0*/
}
```
