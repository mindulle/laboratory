Stacking context
================

**Stacking context** is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML
elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed
to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this
space in priority order based on element attributes.

Description
-----------

In the previous article of this guide, [Using z-index](using_z-index.md),
we showed that the rendering order of certain elements is influenced by
their `z-index` value. This occurs because these elements have special
properties which cause them to form a *stacking context*.

A stacking context is formed, anywhere in the document, by any element
in the following scenarios:

- Root element of the document (`<html>`).
- Element with a [`position`](position.md) value `absolute` or
    `relative` and [`z-index`](z-index.md) value other than `auto`.
- Element with a [`position`](position.md) value `fixed` or
    `sticky` (sticky for all mobile browsers, but not older desktop
    browsers).
- Element with a [`container-type`](container-type.md) value `size`
    or `inline-size` set, intended for [](css_container_queries.md).
- Element that is a child of a
    [flex](basic_concepts_of_flexbox.md)
    container, with [`z-index`](z-index.md) value other than `auto`.
- Element that is a child of a [`grid`](_Resources/Markup%20And%20Styling/css/grid.md) container, with
    [`z-index`](z-index.md) value other than `auto`.
- Element with an [`opacity`](_Resources/Markup%20And%20Styling/css/opacity.md) value less than `1` (See
    [the specification for
    opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#transparency)).
- Element with a [`mix-blend-mode`](mix-blend-mode.md) value other
    than `normal`.
- Element with any of the following properties with value other than
    `none`:
  - [`transform`](transform.md)
  - [`filter`](filter.md)
  - [`backdrop-filter`](backdrop-filter.md)
  - [`perspective`](_Resources/Markup%20And%20Styling/css/perspective.md)
  - [`clip-path`](clip-path.md)
  - [`mask`](mask.md) / [`mask-image`](mask-image.md) /
        [`mask-border`](mask-border.md)
- Element with an [`isolation`](isolation.md) value `isolate`.
- Element with a [`will-change`](will-change.md) value specifying
    any property that would create a stacking context on non-initial
    value (see [this
    post](https://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/)).
- Element with a [`contain`](contain.md) value of `layout`, or
    `paint`, or a composite value that includes either of them (i.e.
    `contain: strict`, `contain: content`).
- Element placed into the [top
    layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer)
    and its corresponding [`::backdrop`](../../::backdrop). Examples
    include
    [fullscreen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API)
    and
    [popover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API)
    elements.

Within a stacking context, child elements are stacked according to the
same rules explained just above. Importantly, the `z-index` values of
its child stacking contexts only have meaning in this parent. Stacking
contexts are treated atomically as a single unit in the parent stacking
context.

In summary:

- Stacking contexts can be contained in other stacking contexts, and
    together create a hierarchy of stacking contexts.
- Each stacking context is completely independent of its siblings:
    only descendant elements are considered when stacking is processed.
- Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element\'s
    contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the
    stacking order of the parent stacking context.

**Note:** The hierarchy of stacking contexts is a subset of the
hierarchy of HTML elements because only certain elements create stacking
contexts. We can say that elements that do not create their own stacking
contexts are *assimilated* by the parent stacking context.

Example
-------

In this example, every positioned element creates its own stacking
context, because of their positioning and `z-index` values. The
hierarchy of stacking contexts is organized as follows:

- Root
  - DIV \#1
  - DIV \#2
  - DIV \#3
    - DIV \#4
    - DIV \#5
    - DIV \#6

It is important to note that DIV \#4, DIV \#5 and DIV \#6 are children
of DIV \#3, so stacking of those elements is completely resolved within
DIV \#3. Once stacking and rendering within DIV \#3 is completed, the
whole DIV \#3 element is passed for stacking in the root element with
respect to its sibling\'s DIV.

DIV \#4 is rendered under DIV \#1 because DIV \#1\'s z-index (5) is
valid within the stacking context of the root element, while DIV \#4\'s
z-index (6) is valid within the stacking context of DIV \#3. So, DIV \#4
is under DIV \#1, because DIV \#4 belongs to DIV \#3, which has a lower
z-index value.

For the same reason DIV \#2 (`z-index`: 2) is rendered under DIV\#5
(`z-index`: 1) because DIV \#5 belongs to DIV \#3, which has a higher
z-index value.

DIV \#3\'s z-index is 4, but this value is independent from z-index of
DIV \#4, DIV \#5 and DIV \#6, because it belongs to a different stacking
context.

An easy way to figure out the *rendering order* of stacked elements
along the z-axis is to think of it as a \"version number\" of sorts,
where child elements are minor version numbers underneath their
parent\'s major version numbers. This way we can easily see how an
element with a z-index of 1 (DIV \#5) is stacked above an element with a
z-index of 2 (DIV \#2), and how an element with a z-index of 6 (DIV \#4)
is stacked below an element with a z-index of 5 (DIV \#1).

In our example (sorted according to the final rendering order):

- Root
  - DIV \#2: (`z-index`: 2)
  - DIV \#3: (`z-index`: 4)
    - DIV \#5: (`z-index`: 1), stacked under an element
            (`z-index`: 4), which results in a rendering order of 4.1
    - DIV \#6: (`z-index`: 3), stacked under an element
            (`z-index`: 4), which results in a rendering order of 4.3
    - DIV \#4: (`z-index`: 6), stacked under an element
            (`z-index`: 4), which results in a rendering order of 4.6
  - DIV \#1: (`z-index`: 5)
