animation
=========

The `animation` [shorthand](shorthand_properties.md)
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property applies
an animation between styles. It is a shorthand for
[`animation-name`](animation-name.md),
[`animation-duration`](animation-duration.md),
[`animation-timing-function`](animation-timing-function.md),
[`animation-delay`](animation-delay.md),
[`animation-iteration-count`](animation-iteration-count.md),
[`animation-direction`](animation-direction.md),
[`animation-fill-mode`](animation-fill-mode.md),
[`animation-play-state`](animation-play-state.md), and
[`animation-timeline`](animation-timeline.md).

Constituent properties
----------------------

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`animation-delay`](animation-delay.md)
- [`animation-direction`](animation-direction.md)
- [`animation-duration`](animation-duration.md)
- [`animation-fill-mode`](animation-fill-mode.md)
- [`animation-iteration-count`](animation-iteration-count.md)
- [`animation-name`](animation-name.md)
- [`animation-play-state`](animation-play-state.md)
- [`animation-timeline`](animation-timeline.md)
- [`animation-timing-function`](animation-timing-function.md)

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
/* @keyframes duration | easing-function | delay |
iteration-count | direction | fill-mode | play-state | name */
animation: 3s ease-in 1s 2 reverse both paused slidein;

/* @keyframes duration | easing-function | delay | name */
animation: 3s linear 1s slidein;

/* two animations */
animation:
  3s linear slidein,
  3s ease-out 5s slideout;
```

The `animation` property is specified as one or more single animations,
separated by commas.

Each individual animation is specified as:

- zero, one, or two occurrences of the [`<time>`](time.md) value
- zero or one occurrences of the following values:
  - [`<single-easing-function>`](animation.md#single-easing-function)
  - [`<single-animation-iteration-count>`](animation.md#single-animation-iteration-count)
  - [`<single-animation-direction>`](animation.md#single-animation-direction)
  - [`<single-animation-fill-mode>`](animation.md#single-animation-fill-mode)
  - [`<single-animation-play-state>`](animation.md#single-animation-play-state)
- an optional name for the animation, which may be `none`, a
    [`<custom-ident>`](custom-ident.md), or a [`<string>`](string.md)

**Note:** [`animation-timeline`](animation-timeline.md),
[`animation-range-start`](animation-range-start.md), and
[`animation-range-end`](animation-range-end.md) are not currently included
in this list, as current implementations are reset-only. This means that
including `animation` resets a previously-declared `animation-timeline`
value to `auto` and previously-declared `animation-range-start` and
`animation-range-end` values to `normal`, but these properties cannot be
set via `animation`. When creating [](css_scroll-driven_animations.md), you need to declare these
properties after declaring any `animation` shorthand for it to take
effect.

### Values

[`<single-easing-function>`](#single-easing-function)

:   Determines the type of transition. The value must be one of those
    available in [`<easing-function>`](easing-function.md).

[`<single-animation-iteration-count>`](#single-animation-iteration-count)

:   The number of times the animation is played. The value must be one
    of those available in
    [`animation-iteration-count`](animation-iteration-count.md).

[`<single-animation-direction>`](#single-animation-direction)

:   The direction in which the animation is played. The value must be
    one of those available in
    [`animation-direction`](animation-direction.md).

[`<single-animation-fill-mode>`](#single-animation-fill-mode)

:   Determines how styles should be applied to the animation\'s target
    before and after its execution. The value must be one of those
    available in [`animation-fill-mode`](animation-fill-mode.md).

[`<single-animation-play-state>`](#single-animation-play-state)

:   Determines whether the animation is playing or not. The value must
    be one of those available in
    [`animation-play-state`](animation-play-state.md).

Description
-----------

The order of time values within each animation definition is important:
the first value that can be parsed as a [`<time>`](time.md) is assigned to
the [`animation-duration`](animation-duration.md), and the second one is
assigned to [`animation-delay`](animation-delay.md).

The order of other values within each animation definition is also
important for distinguishing an [`animation-name`](animation-name.md) value
from other values. If a value in the `animation` shorthand can be parsed
as a value for an animation property other than `animation-name`, then
the value will be applied to that property first and not to
`animation-name`. For this reason, the recommended practice is to
specify a value for `animation-name` as the last value in a list of
values when using the `animation` shorthand; this holds true even when
you specify multiple, comma-separated animations using the `animation`
shorthand.

While an animation name must be set for an animation to be applied, all
values of the `animation` shorthand are optional, and default to the
initial value for each long-hand `animation` component. The initial
value of `animation-name` is `none`, meaning if no `animation-name`
value is declared in the `animation` shorthand property, there is no
animation to apply on any of the properties.

When the `animation-duration` value is omitted from the `animation`
shorthand property, the value for this property defaults to `0s`. In
this case, the animation will still occur (the
[`animationStart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animationstart_event)
and
[`animationEnd`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animationend_event)
events will be fired) but no animation will be visible.

Accessibility concerns
----------------------

Blinking and flashing animation can be problematic for people with
cognitive concerns such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD). Additionally, certain kinds of motion can be a trigger for
Vestibular disorders, epilepsy, and migraine and Scotopic sensitivity.

Consider providing a mechanism for pausing or disabling animation as
well as using the [](prefers-reduced-motion.md) to create a complimentary
experience for users who have expressed a preference for reduced
animated experiences.

Examples
--------

**Note:** Animating [CSS Box Model](css_box_model.md) properties is
discouraged. Animating any box model property is inherently CPU
intensive; consider animating the [transform](transform.md) property
instead.

### Sun Rise

Here we animate a yellow sun across a light blue sky. The sun rises to
the center of the viewport and then falls out of sight.

[html]

```html
<div class="sun"></div>
```

[css]

```css
:root {
  overflow: hidden; /* hides any part of the sun below the horizon */
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* centers the sun in the background */
}

.sun {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 50%; /* creates a circular background */
  height: 100vh; /* makes the sun the size of the viewport */
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  animation: 4s linear 0s infinite alternate sun-rise;
}

@keyframes sun-rise {
  from {
    /* pushes the sun down past the viewport */
    transform: translateY(110vh);
  }
  to {
    /* returns the sun to its default position */
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

### Animating Multiple Properties

Adding onto the sun animation in the previous example, we add a second
animation changing the color of the sun as it rises and sets. The sun
starts off dark red when it is below the horizon and changes to a bright
orange as it reaches the top.

[html]

```html
<div class="sun"></div>
```

[css]

```css
:root {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.sun {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 100vh;
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  animation: 4s linear 0s infinite alternate animating-multiple-properties;
}

/* it is possible to animate multiple properties in a single animation */
@keyframes animating-multiple-properties {
  from {
    transform: translateY(110vh);
    background-color: red;
    filter: brightness(75%);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
    background-color: orange;
    /* unset properties i.e. 'filter' will revert to default values */
  }
}
```

### Applying Multiple Animations

Here is a sun that rises and falls on a lightblue background. The sun
gradually rotates through a rainbow of colors. The timing of the sun\'s
position and color are independent.

[html]

```html
<div class="sun"></div>
```

[css]

```css
:root {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.sun {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 100vh;
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  /* multiple animations are separated by commas, each animation's parameters are set independently */
  animation:
    4s linear 0s infinite alternate rise,
    24s linear 0s infinite psychedelic;
}

@keyframes rise {
  from {
    transform: translateY(110vh);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

@keyframes psychedelic {
  from {
    filter: hue-rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    filter: hue-rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```

### Cascading Multiple Animations

Here is a yellow sun on a lightblue background. The sun bounces between
the left and right sides of the viewport. The sun remains in the
viewport even though a rise animation is defined. The rise animation\'s
transform property is \'overwritten\' by the bounce animation.

[html]

```html
<div class="sun"></div>
```

[css]

```css
:root {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.sun {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 100vh;
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  /*
    animations declared later in the cascade will override the
    properties of previously declared animations
  */
  /* bounce 'overwrites' the transform set by rise, hence the sun only moves horizontally */
  animation:
    4s linear 0s infinite alternate rise,
    4s linear 0s infinite alternate bounce;
}

@keyframes rise {
  from {
    transform: translateY(110vh);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

@keyframes bounce {
  from {
    transform: translateX(-50vw);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(50vw);
  }
}
```
