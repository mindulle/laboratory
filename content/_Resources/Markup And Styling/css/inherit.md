inherit
=======

The `inherit` CSS keyword causes the element to take the [](computed_value.md) of the property from its parent element. It can
be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand property
[`all`](all.md).

For [inherited properties](inheritance.md#inherited_properties), this
reinforces the default behavior, and is only needed to override another
rule.

**Note:** Inheritance is always from the parent element in the document
tree, even when the parent element is not the containing block.

Examples
--------

### Exclude selected elements from a rule

[css]

```css
/* Make second-level headers green */
h2 {
  color: green;
}

/* Leave those in the sidebar alone so they use their parent's color */
#sidebar h2 {
  color: inherit;
}
```

In this example, the `h2` elements inside the sidebar might be different
colors. For example, consider one of them that would by the child of a
`div` matched by the rule:

[css]

```css
div#current {
  color: blue;
}
```

Then, it would be blue.
