image()
=======

The `image()` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[function](css_functions.md) defines an [`<image>`](_Resources/Markup%20And%20Styling/css/image.md) in a
similar fashion to the [`url()`](url.md) function, but with added
functionality including specifying the image\'s directionality,
displaying just a part of that image defined by a media fragment, and
specifying a solid color as a fallback in case none of the specified
images are able to be rendered.

**Note:** The CSS `image()` function should not confused with
[`Image()`, the `HTMLImageElement`
constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/Image).

Syntax
------

```
<image()> = 
  image( <image-tags>? [ <image-src>? , <color>? ]! )  

<image-tags> = 
  ltr  |
  rtl  

<image-src> = 
  <url>     |
  <string>  

<url> = 
  url( <string> <url-modifier>* )  |
  src( <string> <url-modifier>* )  
```

where:

[`image-tags`](#image-tags) [Optional]

:   The directionality of the image, either `ltr` for left-to-right or
    `rtl` for right-to-left.

[`image-src`](#image-src) [Optional]

:   Zero or more [`url()`](url.md)s or [`<string>`](string.md)s
    specifying the image sources, with optional image fragment
    identifiers.

[`color`](#color) [Optional]

:   A color, specifying a solid background color to use as a fallback if
    no `image-src` is found, supported, or declared.

### Bi-directional awareness

The first, optional parameter of the `image()` notation is the
directionality of the image. If included, and the image is used on an
element with opposite directionality, the image will be flipped
horizontally in horizontal writing modes. If the directionality is
omitted, the image won\'t be flipped if the language direction is
changed.

### Image fragments

One key difference between `url()` and `image()` is the ability to add a
media fragment identifier --- a starting point along the x and y axis,
along with a width and height --- onto the image source to display only
a section of the source image. The section of the image defined in the
parameter becomes a standalone image. The syntax looks like so:

[css]

```css
background-image: image("myimage.webp#xywh=0,20,40,60");
```

The background image of the element will be the portion of the image
*myImage.webp* that starts at the coordinate 0px, 20px (the top
left-hand corner) and is 40px wide and 60px tall.

The `#xywh=#,#,#,#` media fragment syntax takes four comma separated
numeric values. The first two represent the X and Y coordinates for the
starting point of the box that will be created. The third value is the
width of the box, and the last value is the height. By default, these
are pixel values. The [spacial dimension definition in the media
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#naming-space)
indicates that percentages will be supported as well:

[css]

```css
xywh=160,120,320,240        /* results in a 320x240 image at x=160 and y=120 */
xywh=pixel:160,120,320,240  /* results in a 320x240 image at x=160 and y=120 */
xywh=percent:25,25,50,50    /* results in a 50%x50% image at x=25% and y=25% */
```

The image fragments can be used in `url()` notation as well. The
`#xywh=#,#,#,#` media fragment syntax is \'backwards compatible\' in
that a media fragment will be ignored if not understood, and won\'t
break the source call when used with `url()`. If the browser doesn\'t
understand the media fragments notation, it ignores the fragment,
displaying the entire image.

Browsers that understand `image()` also understand the fragment
notation. Therefore, if the fragment is not understood within `image()`,
the image will be considered invalid.

### Color fallback

If a color is specified in `image()` along with your image sources, it
acts as a fallback if the images are invalid and do not appear. In such
cases, the `image()` function renders as if no image were included,
generating a solid-color image. As a use case, consider a dark image
being used as a background for some white text. A dark background color
may be needed for foreground text to be legible, if the image does not
render.

Omitting image sources while including a color is valid and creates a
color swatch. Unlike declaring a
[`background-color`](background-color.md), which is placed under or
behind all the background images, this can be used to put (generally
semi-transparent) colors over other images.

The size of the color swatch can be set with the
[`background-size`](background-size.md) property. This is different from
the `background-color`, which sets a color to cover the entire element.
Both `image(color)` and `background-color` placements are impacted by
the [`background-clip`](background-clip.md) and
[`background-origin`](background-origin.md) properties.

Accessibility concerns
----------------------

Browsers do not provide any special information on background images to
assistive technology. This is important primarily for screen readers, as
a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey
nothing to its users. If the image contains information critical to
understanding the page\'s overall purpose, it is better to describe it
semantically in the document.

- [MDN Understanding WCAG, Guideline 1.1
    explanations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable#guideline_1.1_%E2%80%94_providing_text_alternatives_for_non-text_content)
- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1 \| W3C Understanding WCAG
    2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20161007/text-equiv-all.html)

This feature can help improve accessibility by providing a fallback
color when an image fails to load. While this can and should be done by
including a background-color on every background image, the CSS
`image()` function allows adding allows only including background colors
should an image fail to load, which means you can add a fall back color
should a transparent PNG/GIF/WebP not load.

Examples
--------

### Directionally-sensitive images

[html]

```html
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">Bullet is a right facing arrow on the left</li>
  <li dir="rtl">Bullet is the same arrow, flipped to point left.</li>
</ul>
```

[css]

```css
ul {
  list-style-image: image(ltr "rightarrow.png");
}
```

In the left-to-right list items --- those with `dir="ltr"` set on the
element itself or inheriting the directionality from an ancestor or
default value for the page --- the image will be used as-is. List items
with `dir="rtl"` set on the `<li>` or inheriting the right-to-left
directionality from an ancestor, such as documents set to Arabic or
Hebrew, will have the bullet display on the right, horizontally flipped,
as if `transform: scaleX(-1)` had been set. The text will also be
displayed left-to-right.

### Displaying a section of the background image

[html]

```html
<div class="box">Hover over me. What cursor do you see?</div>
```

[css]

```css
.box:hover {
  cursor: image("sprite.png#xywh=32,64,16,16");
}
```

When the user hovers over the box, the cursor will change to display the
16x16 px section of the sprite image, starting at x=32 and y=64.

### Putting color on top of a background image

[css]

```css
.quarterlogo {
  background-image: image(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)), url("firefox.png");
  background-size: 25%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

[html]

```html
<div class="quarterlogo">
  If supported, a quarter of this div has a darkened logo
</div>
```

The above will put a semi-transparent black mask over the Firefox logo
background image. Had we used the
[`background-color`](background-color.md) property instead, the color
would have appeared behind the logo image instead of on top of it.
Additionally, the entire container would have had the same background
color. Because we used `image()` along with the
[`background-size`](background-size.md) property (and prevented the
image from repeating with the
[`background-repeat`](background-repeat.md) property, the color swatch
will only cover a quarter of the container.
