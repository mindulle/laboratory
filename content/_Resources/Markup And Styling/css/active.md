:active
=======

The `:active` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[pseudo-class](pseudo-classes.md) represents an element (such as a button)
that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, \"activation\"
typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.

Try it
------

The `:active` pseudo-class is commonly used on
[`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and
[`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
elements. Other common targets of this pseudo-class include elements
that are *contained in* an activated element, and form elements that are
being activated through their associated
[`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label).

Styles defined by the `:active` pseudo-class will be overridden by any
subsequent link-related pseudo-class ([`:link`](:link),
[`:hover`](:hover), or [`:visited`](:visited)) that has at least equal
specificity. To style links appropriately, put the `:active` rule after
all other link-related rules, as defined by the *LVHA-order*: `:link`
--- `:visited` --- `:hover` --- `:active`.

**Note:** On systems with multi-button mice, CSS specifies that the
`:active` pseudo-class must only apply to the primary button; on
right-handed mice, this is typically the leftmost button.

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
:active {
  /* ... */
}
```
