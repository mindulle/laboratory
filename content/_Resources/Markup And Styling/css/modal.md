:modal
======

The `:modal` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[pseudo-class](pseudo-classes.md) matches an element that is in a state in
which it excludes all interaction with elements outside it until the
interaction has been dismissed. Multiple elements can be selected by the
`:modal` pseudo-class at the same time, but only one of them will be
active and able to receive input.
