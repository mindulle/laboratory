:-moz-first-node
================

**Non-standard:** This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards
track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not
work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between
implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The `:-moz-first-node`
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[pseudo-class](pseudo-classes.md) is a [Mozilla
extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Mozilla_Extensions)
that represents any element that is the first child node of some other
element. It differs from [`:first-child`](:first-child) because it does
not match a first-child element with (non-whitespace) text before it.

**Note:** Any whitespace at the start of an element is ignored for the
determination of `:-moz-first-node`.

Syntax

[css]

```css
:-moz-first-node {
  /* ... */
}
```
