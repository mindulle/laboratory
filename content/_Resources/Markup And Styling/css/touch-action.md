touch-action
============

The `touch-action` CSS property sets how an element\'s region can be
manipulated by a touchscreen user (for example, by zooming features
built into the browser).

By default, panning (scrolling) and pinching gestures are handled
exclusively by the browser. An application using [Pointer
events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events)
will receive a
[`pointercancel`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointercancel_event)
event when the browser starts handling a touch gesture. By explicitly
specifying which gestures should be handled by the browser, an
application can supply its own behavior in
[`pointermove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointermove_event)
and
[`pointerup`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerup_event)
listeners for the remaining gestures. Applications using [Touch
events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events)
disable the browser handling of gestures by calling
[`preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault),
but should also use `touch-action` to ensure the browser knows the
intent of the application before any event listeners have been invoked.

When a gesture is started, the browser intersects the `touch-action`
values of the touched element and its ancestors, up to the one that
implements the gesture (in other words, the first containing scrolling
element). This means that in practice, `touch-action` is typically
applied only to top-level elements which have some custom behavior,
without needing to specify `touch-action` explicitly on any of that
element\'s descendants.

**Note:** After a gesture starts, changes to `touch-action` will not
have any impact on the behavior of the current gesture.

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
/* Keyword values */
touch-action: auto;
touch-action: none;
touch-action: pan-x;
touch-action: pan-left;
touch-action: pan-right;
touch-action: pan-y;
touch-action: pan-up;
touch-action: pan-down;
touch-action: pinch-zoom;
touch-action: manipulation;

/* Global values */
touch-action: inherit;
touch-action: initial;
touch-action: revert;
touch-action: revert-layer;
touch-action: unset;
```

The `touch-action` property may be specified as either:

- One of the keywords `auto`, `none`, [`manipulation`](#manipulation),
    *or*
- One of the keywords `pan-x`, `pan-left`, `pan-right`, and/or one of
    the keywords `pan-y`, `pan-up`, `pan-down`, plus optionally the
    keyword `pinch-zoom`.

### Values

[`auto`](#auto)

:   Enable browser handling of all panning and zooming gestures.

[`none`](#none)

:   Disable browser handling of all panning and zooming gestures.

[`pan-x`](#pan-x)

:   Enable single-finger horizontal panning gestures. May be combined
    with **pan-y**, **pan-up**, **pan-down** and/or **pinch-zoom**.

[`pan-y`](#pan-y)

:   Enable single-finger vertical panning gestures. May be combined with
    **pan-x**, **pan-left**, **pan-right** and/or **pinch-zoom**.

[`manipulation`](#manipulation)

:   Enable panning and pinch zoom gestures, but disable additional
    non-standard gestures such as double-tap to zoom. Disabling
    double-tap to zoom removes the need for browsers to delay the
    generation of **click** events when the user taps the screen. This
    is an alias for \"**pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom**\" (which, for
    compatibility, is itself still valid).

[`pan-left`](#pan-left), `pan-right`, `pan-up`, `pan-down` [Experimental]

:   Enable single-finger gestures that begin by scrolling in the given
    direction(s). Once scrolling has started, the direction may still be
    reversed. Note that scrolling \"up\" (**pan-up**) means that the
    user is dragging their finger downward on the screen surface, and
    likewise **pan-left** means the user is dragging their finger to the
    right. Multiple directions may be combined except when there is a
    simpler representation (for example, **\"pan-left pan-right**\" is
    invalid since \"**pan-x**\" is simpler, but \"**pan-left
    pan-down**\" is valid).

[`pinch-zoom`](#pinch-zoom)

:   Enable multi-finger panning and zooming of the page. This may be
    combined with any of the **pan-** values.

Accessibility concerns
----------------------

A declaration of `touch-action: none;` may inhibit operating a
browser\'s zooming capabilities. This will prevent people experiencing
low vision conditions from being able to read and understand page
content.

Formal definition
-----------------

  ---------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [Initial value](initial_value.md)     `auto`
  Applies to                         all elements except: non-replaced inline elements, table rows, row groups, table columns, and column groups
  [Inherited](inheritance.md)           no
  [Computed value](computed_value.md)   as specified
  Animation type                     Not animatable
  ---------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Formal syntax
-------------

```
touch-action = 
  auto                                                |
  none                                                |
  [ [ pan-x | pan-left | pan-right ] || [ pan-y | pan-up | pan-down ] || pinch-zoom ]  |
  manipulation                                        
```

Examples
--------

### Disabling all gestures

The most common usage is to disable all gestures on an element (and its
non-scrollable descendants) that provides its own dragging and zooming
behavior -- such as a map or game surface.

#### HTML

[html]

```html
<div id="map"></div>
```

#### CSS

[css]

```css
#map {
  height: 150vh;
  width: 70vw;
  background: linear-gradient(blue, green);
  touch-action: none;
}
```
