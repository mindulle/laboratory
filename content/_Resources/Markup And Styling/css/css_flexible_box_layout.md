CSS flexible box layout
=======================

The **CSS flexible box layout** module defines a CSS box model optimized
for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In
the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out
in any direction, and can \"flex\" their sizes, either growing to fill
unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both
horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily
manipulated.

Basic example
-------------

In the following example a container has been set to `display: flex`,
which means that the three child items become flex items. The value of
`justify-content` has been set to `space-between` in order to space the
items out evenly on the main axis. An equal amount of space is placed
between each item with the left and right items being flush with the
edges of the flex container. You can also see that the items are
stretching on the cross axis, due to the default value of `align-items`
being `stretch`. The items stretch to the height of the flex container,
making them each appear as tall as the tallest item.
