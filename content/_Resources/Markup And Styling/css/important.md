!important
==========

A `!` delimiter followed by the `important` keyword marks the
declaration as important. The `!important` flag alters the rules
selecting declarations inside the [cascade](cascade.md). A declaration that
is not *important* is called *normal*.

To mark a declaration important, add the *important flag* (`!important`)
after the value in the declaration. While white space is allowed between
the delimiter and the keyword, the flag is generally written as
`!important` without any white space.

[css]

```css
selector {
  property: value; /* normal declaration */
  property: value !important; /* important declaration (preferred) */
  property: value ! important; /* important declaration (not preferred) */
}
```

The `!important` comes after the value of the property value pair
declaration, preceded by at least one space. The important flag must be
the last token in the declaration. In other words, there can be white
space and comments between the flag and the declaration\'s ending
semicolon, but nothing else.

Impact on the cascade
---------------------

When it comes to important declarations, the [](cascade.md) are reversed. Without the important flag, declarations
in the author\'s style sheets override declarations in a user\'s style
sheet, which override declarations in the user-agent\'s default style
sheet.

When a declaration is important, the order of precedence is reversed.
Declarations marked as important in the user-agent style sheets override
all important declarations in the user style sheets. Similarly, all
important declarations in the user style sheets override all important
declarations in the author\'s style sheets. Finally, all important
declarations take precedence over all animations.

**Note:** All important declarations take precedence over all
animations. `!important` is not valid within [](@keyframes.md) declarations.

Reversing the precedence order for important declarations ensures users
with special needs, such as personalized color schemes or large fonts,
can override author styles when needed by marking some declarations in
their user\'s style sheet as important. It also guarantees malicious
extensions can\'t override important user-agent styles, which might
break functionality or negatively impact security.

Does anything have precedence over important declarations? Yes,
[transitions](css_transitions.md). CSS transitions are a way to control the
speed at which the property changes from one value to another. While
transitioning from one value to another, a property will not match a
specific important declaration.

[css]

```css
a {
  color: red !important;
  background-color: yellow;
  transition: all 2s linear;
}
a:hover {
  color: blue !important;
  background-color: orange !important;
}
```

In this example, the `color` and `background-color` properties will
transition to the hovered state over two seconds. Even though default
states are normal declarations and hover states are `!important`
declarations, the transition does happen.

### Cascade layers

Within each of the three origins for style sheets -- author, user, and
user-agent -- normal declarations in unlayered styles override layered
style declarations, with the last declared having precedence over the
layers declared before it. Important declarations reverse the order of
precedence: important declarations in the first layer take precedence
over important declarations in the next layer, and so on. Also, all the
important declarations have precedence over important declarations made
outside any layer.

### Inline styles

Inline styles are styles defined using the
[`style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/style)
attributes. They can also be normal or important. Inline *normal* styles
take precedence over all *normal* declarations, no matter the origin.
Inline *important* styles take precedence over all other *important*
author styles, no matter the layer, but important styles from user\'s or
user-agent\'s style sheets and transitions override them.

### !important and specificity

While `!important` is not part of determining specificity, it is
related. Important declarations override all other declarations from the
same [origin and cascade layer](cascade.md).

[css]

```css
#myElement#myElement#myElement .myClass.myClass p:hover {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red !important;
}
```

This example displays a case of over-specifying a selector. No matter
how high the selector [specificity](specificity.md) matches a normal
declaration, an important declaration from the same source and cascade
layer will always have precedence. In this case, the paragraph will
always be red.

When two important declarations from the same origin and layer apply to
the same element, browsers select and use the declaration with the
highest specificity.

[css]

```css
#myElement p {
  color: green !important;
}

p {
  color: purple !important;
}
```

In this case, the selector specificity matters. Only if the selectors
had the same specificity would source order matter.

Impact on shorthand properties
------------------------------

Declaring a shorthand property with `!important` sets all of
sub-properties as important. The two following selector style blocks are
equivalent:

[css]

```css
p {
  background: blue !important;
}

p {
  background-image: none !important;
  background-position: 0 0 !important;
  background-size: auto auto !important;
  background-repeat: repeat !important;
  background-origin: padding-box !important;
  background-clip: border-box !important;
  background-attachment: scroll !important;
  background-color: blue !important;
}
```

This example shows one of the several reasons avoiding the important
flag is generally recommended.

Impact on custom properties
---------------------------

When the `!important` flag is added to a custom property value
declaration, it makes the value assignment important. The `!important`
flag is then stripped from the custom property value. The `!important`
flag is not passed as part of the custom property value to the
[`var()`](var().md) function.

[css]

```css
:root {
  --myColor: red !important;
  --myColor: blue;
}
p {
  color: var(--myColor);
}
blockquote {
  color: var(--myColor);
  color: purple;
}
```

In this example, the paragraph will be red, not blue, as the custom
property value assignment is important. The blockquote will be purple,
because the purple normal declaration comes after the normal red
declaration.

Best practices
--------------

Avoid using `!important` to override specificity. When intentionally
creating important declarations for UI requirements, comment in your CSS
code to explain to maintainers why they should not override that
feature.

Even when working to override high-specificity styles not under your
control, such as styles in a 3rd party plugin declared with an [](id_selectors.md), you don\'t need to use `!important`. Consider
instead importing the 3rd party stylesheet script into a [](@layer.md) as your first cascade layer, instead of using
`!important`. As long as the external styles do not include important
declarations, your styles will take precedence over the widget styles,
no matter the specificity.

If you need to override an external stylesheet containing important
declarations, create a cascade layer containing the needed overrides,
and declare that layer first.

### Accessibility

Important styles from a user stylesheet take precedence over the author
style sheet\'s important declarations, meaning adding an `!important`
flag to a site\'s styles will not prevent individual users with special
requirements, such as large fonts, from being able to override your
styles by adding important styles in their own user\'s style sheet.
