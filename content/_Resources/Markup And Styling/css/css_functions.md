CSS value functions
===================

**CSS value functions** are statements that invoke special data
processing or calculations to return a
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[value](css_values_and_units.md) for a CSS property. CSS value functions
represent more complex [data types](css_types.md) and they may take some
input arguments to calculate the return value.

Syntax
------

[css]

```css
selector {
  property: function([argument]? [, argument]!);
}
```

The value syntax starts with the **name of the function**, followed by a
left parenthesis `(`. Next up are the argument(s), and the function is
finished off with a closing parenthesis `)`.

Functions can take multiple arguments, which are formatted similarly to
CSS property values. Whitespace is allowed, but they are optional inside
the parentheses. In some functional notations multiple arguments are
separated by commas, while others use spaces.

**Note:** The CSS value functions are used as property values and should
not be confused with pseudo-classes. The [](pseudo-classes.md#functional_pseudo-classes), [](pseudo-classes.md#linguistic_pseudo-classes), and several
[](pseudo-classes.md#tree-structural_pseudo-classes) require
parameter values, but they\'re not value functions. The [](at-rule.md#conditional_group_rules) are also not value functions;
the parentheses are used for groupings.

CSS counter functions are generally used with the [`content`](content.md)
property, although in theory, they may be used wherever a
[`<string>`](string.md) is supported.

[`counter()`](counter.md)

:   Returns a string representing the current value of the named counter
    if there is one.

[`counters()`](counters.md)

:   Enables nested counters, returning a concatenated string
    representing the current values of the named counters, if there are
    any.

[`symbols()`](symbols.md)

---------------

The [`<basic-shape>`](basic-shape.md) CSS [data type](css_types.md) represents
a graphical shape. It is used in the [`clip-path`](clip-path.md),

Reference functions
-------------------

    another property.

Grid functions
--------------

The following functions are used to define a [](css_grid_layout.md).

[`fit-content()`](fit-content.md)

:   Clamps a given size to an available size according to the formula
    `min(maximum size, max(minimum size, argument))`.

[`minmax()`](minmax.md)

:   Defines a size range greater-than or equal-to *min* and less-than or
    equal-to *max*.

[`repeat()`](repeat.md)

:   Represents a repeated fragment of the track list, allowing a large
    number of columns or rows that exhibit a recurring pattern.

Font functions
--------------

CSS font functions are used with the
[`font-variant-alternates`](font-variant-alternates.md) property to control
the use of alternate glyphs.

[`stylistic()`](font-variant-alternates.md#stylistic)

:   Enables stylistic alternates for individual characters. The
    parameter is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It corresponds
    to the OpenType value `salt`, like `salt 2`.

[`styleset()`](font-variant-alternates.md#styleset)

:   Enables stylistic alternatives for sets of characters. The parameter
    is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It corresponds to the
    OpenType value `ssXY`, such as `ss02`.

[`character-variant()`](font-variant-alternates.md#character-variant)

:   Enables specific stylistic alternatives for characters. It is
    similar to `styleset()`, but doesn\'t create coherent glyphs for a
    set of characters; individual characters will have independent and
    not necessarily coherent styles. The parameter is a font-specific
    name mapped to a number. It corresponds to the OpenType value
    `cvXY`, such as `cv02`.

[`swash()`](font-variant-alternates.md#swash)

:   Enables
    [swash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swash_%28typography%29)
    glyphs. The parameter is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It
    corresponds to the OpenType values `swsh` and `cswh`, such as
    `swsh 2` and `cswh 2`.

[`ornaments()`](font-variant-alternates.md#ornaments)

:   Enables ornaments such as
    [fleurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_%28typography%29)
    and other dingbat glyphs. The parameter is a font-specific name
    mapped to a number. It corresponds to the OpenType value `ornm`,
    such as `ornm 2`.

[`annotation()`](font-variant-alternates.md#annotation)

:   Enables annotations such as circled digits or inverted characters.
    The parameter is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It
    corresponds to the OpenType value `nalt`, such as `nalt 2`.

Easing functions
----------------

The following functions are used as a value in transition and animation
properties.

[`linear()`](easing-function.md#linear_easing_function)

:   Iteration along a specified number of stops along the transition,
    displaying each stop for equal lengths of time.

Animation functions
-------------------

The following functions are used as a value of different
`animation-timeline` properties. See
[`animation-timeline`](animation-timeline.md) for more details about these.

[`scroll()`](scroll.md)

:   Sets the [`animation-timeline`](animation-timeline.md) of an element to
    an *anonymous scroll progress timeline*.
