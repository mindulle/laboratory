max()
=====

The `max()` [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[function](css_functions.md) lets you set the largest (most positive) value
from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of a CSS
property value. The `max()` function can be used anywhere a
[`<length>`](length.md), [`<frequency>`](frequency.md), [`<angle>`](angle.md),
[`<time>`](time.md), [`<percentage>`](percentage.md), [`<number>`](number.md), or
[`<integer>`](integer.md) is allowed.

Try it
------

In the first example shown above, the width will be at least 400px, but
will be wider if the viewport is more than 2000px wide (in which case
1vw would be 20px, so 20vw would be 400px). This technique uses an
absolute unit to specify a fixed minimum value for the property, and a
relative unit to allow the value to grow to suit larger viewports.

Syntax
------

The `max()` function takes one or more comma-separated expressions as
its parameter, with the largest (most positive) expression value used as
the value of the property to which it is assigned.

The expressions can be math expressions (using arithmetic operators),
literal values, or other expressions, such as [`attr()`](attr.md), that
evaluate to a valid argument type (like [`<length>`](length.md)), or nested
[`min()`](min.md) and `max()` functions.

You can use different units for each value in your expression. You may
also use parentheses to establish computation order when needed.

### Notes

- Math expressions involving percentages for widths and heights on
    table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups,
    and table cells in both auto and fixed layout tables *may* be
    treated as if `auto` had been specified.
- It is permitted to nest `min()` and other `max()` functions as
    expression values. The expressions are full math expressions, so you
    can use direct addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
    without using the calc() function itself.
- The expression can be values combining the addition ( + ),
    subtraction ( - ), multiplication ( \* ) and division ( / )
    operators, using standard operator precedence rules. Make sure to
    put a space on each side of the + and - operands. The operands in
    the expression may be any \<length\> syntax value.
- You can (and often need to) combine `min()` and `max()` values, or
    use `max()` within a `clamp()` or `calc()` function.

### Formal syntax

```
<max()> = 
  max( <calc-sum># )  

<calc-sum> = 
  <calc-product> [ [ '+' | '-' ] <calc-product> ]*  

<calc-product> = 
  <calc-value> [ [ '*' | '/' ] <calc-value> ]*  

<calc-value> = 
  <number>         |
  <dimension>      |
  <percentage>     |
  <calc-constant>  |
  ( <calc-sum> )   

<calc-constant> = 
  e          |
  pi         |
  infinity   |
  -infinity  |
  NaN        
```

Examples

### Setting a minimum size for a font

Another use case for `max()` is to allow a font size to grow while
ensuring it is at least a minimum size, enabling responsive font sizes
while ensuring legibility.

Let\'s look at some CSS:

[css]

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}
h1.responsive {
  font-size: max(4vw, 2em, 2rem);
}
```

The font-size will at minimum be 2rems, or twice the default size of
font for the page. This ensures that it is legible and accessible.

[html]

```html
<h1>This text is always legible, but doesn't change size</h1>
<h1 class="responsive">
  This text is always legible, and is responsive, to a point
</h1>
```

Think of the `max()` function as finding the minimum value allowed for a
property.

Accessibility concerns
----------------------

When `max()` is used for controlling text size, make sure the text is
always large enough to read. A suggestion is to use the [`min()`](min.md)
function nested within a `max()` that has as its second value a
[relative length unit](length.md#relative_length_units) that is always
large enough to read. For example:

[css]

```css
small {
  font-size: max(min(0.5vw, 0.5em), 1rem);
}
```

This ensures a minimum size of *1rem*, with a text size that scales if
the page is zoomed.
