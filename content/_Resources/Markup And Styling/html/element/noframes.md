\<noframes\>: The Frame Fallback element
========================================

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some
browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from
the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or
may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the [compatibility
table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your
decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The `<noframes>` [HTML](../index) element provides content to be
presented in browsers that don\'t support (or have disabled support for)
the [`<frame>`](frame) element. Although most commonly-used browsers
support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use
browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.

A `<noframes>` element can contain any HTML elements that are allowed
within the body of an HTML document, except for the
[`<frameset>`](frameset) and [`<frame>`](frame) elements, since using
frames when they aren\'t supported doesn\'t make sense.

`<noframes>` can be used to present a message explaining that the
user\'s browser doesn\'t support frames, but ideally should be used to
present an alternate form of the site that doesn\'t use frames but still
offers the same or similar functionality.

**Note:** This element is obsolete and shouldn\'t be used, since the
[`<frame>`](frame) and [`<frameset>`](frameset) elements are also
obsolete. When frames are needed at all, they should be presented using
the [`<iframe>`](iframe) element.

Attributes
----------

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [](_Resources/Markup%20And%20Styling/html/global_attributes/index.md). It has no other attributes available.

Example
-------

In this example, we see a frameset with two frames. In addition,
`<noframes>` is used to present an explanatory message if the [user
agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent)
doesn\'t support frames.

[html]

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <!-- Document metadata goes here -->
  </head>
  <frameset rows="45%, 55%">
    <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/frameset" />
    <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/frame" />
    <noframes>
      <p>
        It seems your browser does not support frames or is configured to not
        allow them.
      </p>
    </noframes>
  </frameset>
