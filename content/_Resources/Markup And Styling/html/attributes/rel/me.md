rel=me
======

The `me` keyword for the [`rel`](../../element/link#rel) attribute of
the [`<link>`](../../element/link) and [`<a>`](../../element/a) elements
indicates that the current resource is represented by the linked party.
The `me` value was introduced in the [XHTML Friends Network (XFN)
specification](https://gmpg.org/xfn/).

[html]

```html
<link rel="me" value="example.com" />
```

The `rel="me"` attribute is used in
[RelMeAuth](https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth) and [Web sign
in](https://microformats.org/wiki/web-sign-in) specifications as a way
to enable a person to identify themselves to a web service using their
domain name or a particular URL.
