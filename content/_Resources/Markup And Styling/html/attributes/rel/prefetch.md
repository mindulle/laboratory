rel=prefetch
============

The `prefetch` keyword for the [`rel`](../../element/link#rel) attribute
of the [`<link>`](../../element/link) element provides a hint to
browsers that the user is likely to need the target resource for future
navigations, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user
experience by preemptively fetching and caching the resource.
`<link rel="prefetch">` is used for same-site navigation resources, or
for subresources used by same-site pages.

The result is kept in the HTTP cache on disk. Because of this it is
useful for prefetching subresources, even if they are not used by the
current page. You could also use it to prefetch the next document the
user will likely visit on the site. However, as a result you need to be
careful with headers --- for example certain
[Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control)
headers could block prefetching (for example `no-cache` or `no-store`).

**Note:** Because of such limitations, you are advised to use the
[Speculation Rules
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API)
for document prefetches instead, where it is supported.

`<link rel="prefetch">` is functionally equivalent to a
[`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) call
with a `priority: "low"` option set on it, except that the former will
generally have an even lower priority, and it will have a
[`Sec-Purpose: prefetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Purpose)
header set on the request. Note that in general browsers will give
prefetch resources a lower priority than preload ones (e.g. requested
via [`<link rel="preload">`](preload)) --- the current page is more
important than the next.

The fetch request for a `prefetch` operation results in an HTTP request
that includes the HTTP header
[`Sec-Purpose: prefetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Purpose).
A server might use this header to change the cache timeouts for the
resources, or perform other special handling. The request will also
include the
[`Sec-Fetch-Dest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Dest)
header with the value set to `empty`.

The
[`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept)
header in the request will match the value used for normal navigation
requests. This allows the browser to find the matching cached resources
following navigation.

Examples
--------

### Basic prefetch

[js]

```js
<link rel="prefetch" href="main.js" />
```

### Navigation and subresource prefetches

Prefetching can be used to fetch both HTML and sub-resources for a
possible next navigation. A common use case is to have a simple website
landing page that fetches more \"heavy-weight\" resources used by the
rest of the site.

[html]

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="/app/style.css" />
<link rel="prefetch" href="/landing-page" />
```

### The effects of cache partitioning

Many browsers now implement some form of [cache
partitioning](https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/http-cache-partitioning/),
which makes `<link rel="prefetch">` useless for resources intended for
use by different top-level sites. This includes the main document when
navigating cross-site. So, for example, the following prefetch:

[html]

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="https://news.example/article" />
```

Would not be accessible from `https://aggregator.example/`.
