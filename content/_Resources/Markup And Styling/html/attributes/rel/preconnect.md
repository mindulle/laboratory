rel=preconnect
==============

 
The `preconnect` keyword for the [`rel`](../../element/link#rel)
attribute of the [`<link>`](../../element/link) element is a hint to
browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the target
resource\'s origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve the
user experience by preemptively initiating a connection to that origin.
Preconnecting speeds up future loads from a given origin by preemptively
performing part or all of the handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP, and
DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins).

`<link rel="preconnect">` will provide a benefit to any future
cross-origin HTTP request, navigation or subresource. It has no benefit
on same-origin requests because the connection is already open.

If a page needs to make connections to many third-party domains,
preconnecting them all can be counterproductive. The
`<link rel="preconnect">` hint is best used for only the most critical
connections. For the others, just use
[`<link rel="dns-prefetch">`](dns-prefetch) to save time on the first
step --- the DNS lookup.


Examples
--------

 
 
[html]

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com" />
```



You can also implement preconnect as an HTTP
[Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link)
header, for example:

 
[http]

```http
Link: https://example.com>; rel="preconnect"
```
